# End-to-end test of the installer the website serves at /install.
#
# C-1 in docs/upcoming/security-audit-plan.md. That endpoint used to run
# `brew install --HEAD`, which built whatever was on main and verified nothing.
# It now bootstraps tvm and installs the latest RELEASE, checksum-verified.
# Three things have to hold for that to be worth anything, and all three are
# asserted here against a fake GitHub built out of file:// URLs -- no network,
# no real release, no Homebrew:
#
#   1. The happy path actually installs a working tur.
#   2. A TAMPERED asset is refused. This is the whole point: before WP7's C-2
#      fix, tvm's checksum step fell through to a successful install every way
#      it could fail to run.
#   3. The script the Worker SERVES is the one tested -- it is fetched from
#      worker.js's own /install route, not copy-pasted, so an edit to the
#      route that breaks the script fails here.
#
# Needs node (to drive the Worker module) and a host with a release target.
# Skips cleanly without either.
