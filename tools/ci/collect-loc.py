"""Count tracked lines of code, split product / test / generated, as one JSON row.

Published to the `ci-metrics` orphan branch alongside the suite timings (see
tools/ci/publish-timings.sh) and charted by /ci.  One row per push to `main`,
NOT one per matrix leg: a line count is a property of the commit, so unlike a
suite duration it has no (os, cc, nproc) dimension and must not be published
once per runner.

WHY NOT `wc -l {src,stdlib}/**/*.{c,h,tur}`:

  * It counts files git does not track -- a build tree under src/, an editor
    backup, a stale .c somebody forgot to delete -- so the number moves without
    a commit moving it.
  * It counts GENERATED files as if a person wrote them.  In this repo that is
    not a rounding error: tests/fixtures/*/expected.c is ~1.54M lines, nine
    times every hand-written line in the tree put together, and it jumps by
    hundreds of thousands of lines whenever the emitter changes a preamble.
    Folded into "test code" it would be the only thing the chart ever showed.
  * A brace glob is shell-specific (bash needs globstar; sh has no `**` at all)
    and silently expands to the literal pattern when it matches nothing, so a
    renamed directory reads as zero rather than as an error.

So: enumerate `git ls-files`, keep what a known code extension claims, drop the
generated paths explicitly, and classify the rest by path.  Every file that is
counted lands in exactly one bucket, and the row carries the counts the buckets
were derived from so a reader can check the arithmetic rather than trust it.

Lines are physical lines, blanks and comments included, so the number stays
comparable with the one anybody measures by hand.  Stripping blanks or comments
would need a comment grammar per language and a second argument about which of
them counts.  The one deliberate divergence from `wc -l` is a file whose last
line has no trailing newline: that is a line, and it is counted.

Usage:
    collect-loc.py                      # one JSON object on stdout
    collect-loc.py --repo /path/to/repo
    collect-loc.py --explain            # per-bucket, per-language breakdown to stderr
