/* test_hamt_val_ops.c -- caller-supplied VALUE ownership unit test.
 *
 * collections-cannot-hold-rc-values, map side, step (b).  Value ownership used
 * to be a single `bool val_owned` on the map, and the ops it selected were
 * hardcoded to the tur_hamt_box_key box refcount.  That is fine for a boxed
 * multi-word value, but an rc<T> value is not a box -- its lifetime runs
 * through rc_strong_increment / rc_strong_decrement, which the map had no way
 * to be told about.  The map now stores caller-supplied value ops, threaded
 * in through the tur_hamt_{set,del}_eq_vo entry points and kept on the
 * resulting map so a later tur_hamt_free releases with the SAME ops.
 *
 * What this asserts:
 *
 *   1. The caller's ops are the ones that actually run -- not the box ops.
 *      Both counters here are plain statics over stack storage; if the box
 *      refcount were still hardcoded it would be handed a non-box pointer and
 *      ASan would fire immediately.
 *   2. Retain/release are BALANCED across structural sharing.  Every reference
 *      the map mints (collision-chain copies) is released exactly once, plus
 *      the one incoming reference per stored entry.
 *   3. The ops survive onto derived maps.  A set/del produces a NEW map, and
 *      freeing that later map must use the ops the original was built with.
 *   4. owned == 0 leaves value lifetime completely untouched (the common
 *      single-word int/cstr/handle value rides the carrier inline).
 *
 * Built and run by tests/run-hamt-val-ops.sh.
