# tests/run-r7rs-sanitize.sh -- r7rs-lang-plan T8: every `#lang r7rs` fixture
# compiled with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and run.
#
# tests/run.sh builds fixture programs WITHOUT sanitizers, so a use-after-free,
# an overflow or undefined behavior in the prelude's inline C, the emitted
# Scheme code or the runtime under it passes the ordinary suite whenever the
# output happens to come out right.  This harness makes those fatal:
#
#   - ASan aborts on the first memory error;
#   - UBSan is built with -fno-sanitize-recover, so a finding aborts too;
#   - each fixture must still print its expected.stdout and exit with its
#     expected.exit (0 when there is none);
#   - a fixture carrying `sanitize.torture` (an interval) runs with
#     TUR_GC_TORTURE set to it: the r7rs-threads-* stress cases, whose point
#     is the collector stopping threads mid-allocation, under ASan.
#
# LEAKS ARE NOT CHECKED here (detect_leaks=0), on purpose: a Scheme program's
# pairs, vectors, strings and procedures are never freed -- the memory model
# has no collector for them -- so every fixture leaks by design.  That is
# docs/reported/r7rs-heap-data-never-reclaimed.md; the scratch leaks T8 found
# are fixed, and the plan's T8 note tabulates what is freed and what is not.
#
# The interpreter side needs no harness of its own: `tur --interpret` is the
# sanitized Debug binary, so tests/run-turi.sh already runs every r7rs fixture
# under ASan and UBSan.
#
# Built at -O1 (ASan's stack traces keep their frames) plus
# -foptimize-sibling-calls: a CPS prelude loop is constant-stack only when the
# C compiler makes its self call a jump, which gcc does from -O2
# (docs/reported/cps-self-tail-call-relies-on-sibling-call.md).
#
# Linux only, like run-leak-check.sh.  Exit 0 when every fixture is clean.
