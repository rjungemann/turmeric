# tests/check-export-from-no-wrapper.sh -- (export-from ...) must not emit a
# forwarding wrapper.
#
# The whole point of the form is that re-exporting is free: a consumer of the
# re-exporting module resolves to the DEFINING module's binding and calls its
# mangled symbol directly. A wrapper per re-exported name per hop would be a
# silent cost that nothing else would catch -- the behaviour fixture next door
# (tests/fixtures/module-export-from) prints the right numbers either way.
#
# The fixture chains chain/low -> chain/mid -> chain/hi -> input.tur, so
# `low-add` is re-exported twice. Assert that the emitted C holds exactly one
# definition of it, named for the module that DEFINED it, and no chain__mid__
# or chain__hi__ copy.
