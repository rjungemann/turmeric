# tests/turi/repl-lang-saffron.sh -- saffron-lang-plan S8: the REPL can be a
# Saffron session, by flag or by `#lang` at the prompt.
#
# The distinguishing probe is a FLOAT ADD through an unannotated defn:
#
#   (defn add [a b] (+ a b))
#   (add 1.5 2.25)
#
# Under Turmeric's defaults the parameters are `int`, so this is
# `TUR-E0001: function 'add' arg 1: expected int, got float`.  Under Saffron
# they are `any` and it answers 3.75.  `(add 1 2)` would NOT distinguish them --
# it is 3 either way -- which is why every case here uses fractional floats.
#
# What this pins, and why each half existed:
#
#   1. `--lang saffron` starts a Saffron session.  New flag.
#   2. `#lang saffron` at the prompt switches an already-running one.  This was
#      ACCEPTED AND SILENTLY IGNORED before: the REPL read the line with
#      `detect_lang_layered`, which reports only the READER axis, so `saffron`
#      came back as plain `turmeric`, the "already set" early-out fired, and the
#      language half was dropped.  A reader following docs/guides/saffron-guide.md
#      types that line first.
#   3. The DEFAULT is still Turmeric.  Without this a "fix" that made every
#      session Saffron would pass 1 and 2.
#   4. A bad `--lang` is REPORTED, exits nonzero, and does not start a
#      session -- it must not fall back to Turmeric silently.  The exit code
#      was not asserted at first: every error path in this subcommand reused
#      `usage_repl()`, which returns 0, so `tur repl --bogus-flag` also exited
#      0 (cli-usage-error-paths-exit-zero, since fixed: error paths go through
#      `usage_error`, which exits 2, and the status is asserted here too).
#
# Skips cleanly (exit 0) when the binary is missing, like its siblings.
