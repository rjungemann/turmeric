# tests/check-examples.sh -- `tur check` sweep over examples/, ratcheted.
#
# Nothing under tests/ or CMakeLists.txt referenced examples/ before this, so
# nothing compiled them and they rotted: at the time this was added, 9 of 17
# failed `tur check`, including four of the five datalog files the
# datalog-01..05 tutorial series walks through line by line.
#
# This is a RATCHET, not a gate. examples/examples-check-baseline.txt lists the
# files known to fail today, each with its reason. The sweep fails when:
#
#   * a file NOT in the baseline fails       -- a regression, fix it; or
#   * a file IN the baseline now passes      -- good news, drop it from the
#                                               baseline so it is protected.
#
# The second direction is what keeps the list honest: without it a baseline
# silently becomes a list of things nobody ever fixed.

# error -- it prints one line and the compiler carries on, so a real defect in
# the compiler can pass right through a sweep that only looks at the exit code.
# One did: `(perform ...)` in statement position shares its emit_stmt case with
# EX_HANDLE and read `is_unsafe_marker` out of the wrong union member, which
# surfaced only as "runtime error: load of value 190" on stderr while checking
# examples/snake. Whether that byte happens to be non-zero is uninitialized
# memory, so it cannot be pinned by a fixture -- but it can be caught here, on
# every example, for free. A Release `tur` prints nothing and this is a no-op.

#
# `tur check` passing is not the bar and was twice mistaken for one. The most
# expensive instance: all five examples/datalog files type-checked and every
# one of them segfaulted, because `rvec-get`'s inline C did
# `return (int)vec->data[i];` -- C's `int` is 32 bits, so a 64-bit datum
# pointer came back truncated. Nothing a checker looks at could have caught
# that; running it takes under five seconds for the whole tree.
#
# examples/examples-run-baseline.txt lists examples that cannot run in CI (a
# display, a listener, an interactive input) with a reason each. It is empty
# today, and this ratchet also fails if a listed example starts running, so it
# cannot decay into a list nobody revisits.
