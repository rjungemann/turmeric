# tests/run-any-type-id-multi-module.sh -- pin `any-type-ids-are-per-tu`.
#
# An `any` box carries a type id.  That id used to be `TUR_ANY_ID_BASE +
# first-seen index` within one `EmitCtx` -- and `EmitCtx` is per translation
# unit, so two TUs numbered the same type differently.  A value widened in one
# module was then misidentified in another, four ways:
#
#   1. `type-of` returned a DIFFERENT type's name.
#   2. `is?` was a false negative on the correct type.
#   3. A valid `cast` panicked ("cast: any holds Beta, not Beta" in the
#      degenerate case, another type's name in general).
#   4. `__tur_any_drop` read the wrong row's `boxed` flag, so one TU called
#      free() on a handle another TU owned -- or leaked, in the mirror case.
#
# IMPORTANT, and the reason this harness exists at all: `tur build <dir>` on a
# single-`main` project reroutes to a WHOLE-PROGRAM single-file build that
# inlines every module into one TU.  One `EmitCtx`, one consistent numbering,
# bug invisible.  Every existing `any` fixture goes through that path, which is
# exactly why four wrong behaviours went unnoticed.  Only separate compilation
# (`tur build --shared`, and `emit-c --output-dir`) splits the numbering, so
# this drives the library build to pin it -- and runs BOTH build modes, because
# agreeing with itself is not the same as being right.
#
# The fix makes the id a hash of the type's identity key (no coordination
# needed between TUs) and publishes name+boxed rows into a runtime registry
# that lookups walk the union of.
