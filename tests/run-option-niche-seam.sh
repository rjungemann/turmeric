# tests/run-option-niche-seam.sh -- keep the option niche's OFF path from
# rotting, now that the niche is the default.
#
# An eligible `(Option P)` is carried as its payload pointer by default since
# the experiment graduated out of --enable=option-niche on 2026-09-03
# (docs/archive/sr3-option-niche-plan.md), and a Vec stores such an element
# as that word (container-element-form-plan, CE2).  TUR_OPTION_NICHE=0 restores
# the tagged 16-byte monomorph and the boxed slot for bisection -- which means
# nothing in the ordinary suite compiles the eligible population through the
# tagged form any more.  A gate nobody turns on decays to a gate nobody
# notices (the SR4 seam's lesson); this harness keeps the OFF path green so a
# bisection stays a one-variable switch instead of a re-excavation.  Before the
# flip it kept the niche path green the same way, and it is where the class-2
# double-wrap defect of 2026-09-03 should have been caught -- the population
# now carries the generic-helper and closure-comparator shapes that found it.
#
# Two checks, mirroring run-sr4-seam.sh:
#   1. A CANARY: emit-c of httpd-req-string-opt under TUR_OPTION_NICHE=0 must
#      mint the tagged `tur_adt_Option__String` typedef and must NOT emit the
#      niche identity ctor.  If the env var is renamed or the gate stops reading
#      it, this fails LOUDLY instead of silently re-testing the default.
#   2. The niche-eligible population, compiled and RUN with the niche OFF
#      against each fixture's committed expected.stdout.
#
# Exit status: 0 if all checks pass, 1 otherwise.

# --- 2. The eligible population, compiled and RUN with the niche OFF. -------
# option-niche-*: the niche's own fixtures (the ordinary suite covers them on
#   the default path; running them here with the niche off is the point).
#   option-niche-vec-closure-cmp carries the closure-comparator shapes
#   (typed `vec-eq?` comparator, let-bound slot word, `(eq? v w)` through
#   the synthesized `__cmp_slot_` comparator); its output is the same either
#   way.  The generic-helper shape (option-niche-vec-word, a `push-it`/
#   `get-it` spec) is NOT here: it asserts the word form itself ("word" vs
#   "box"), and its `get-it` spec does not even build with the niche off --
#   docs/reported/generic-vec-read-wrapper-spec-returns-carrier-word.md, the
#   pre-existing tagged-element defect.  The ordinary suite covers it.
# httpd-req-string-opt / bound-string / inline-c-option-byval-param: the
#   (Option String) census shapes -- header lookups, bounds, inline-C
#   builders straddling the by-value param ABI.
# inline-c-result-builder / inline-c-typed-result-option: Result stays
#   carrier/by-value next to a niche Option in one program.
# option-of-tvec-eq: the original SR3 gate fixture -- an eligible
#   option<Vec int> through a typeclass Eq dictionary's erased crossing.
