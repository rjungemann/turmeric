# tests/run-transitive-cmake-deps.sh -- regression checks for the
# transitive `:cmake-deps` resolver (docs/archive/history/transitive-cmake-deps-plan.md).
#
# Covers the two cheap-and-deterministic cases the plan asks for:
#   1. transitive-cmake-deps-cycle    -- A→B→A in :spices; resolver must
#                                        terminate via its visited set.
#   2. transitive-cmake-deps-conflict -- two siblings declare the same
#                                        :cmake-deps name with different :refs;
#                                        resolver must emit the "conflicting
#                                        :cmake-deps" diagnostic and exit
#                                        non-zero before invoking cmake.
#
# Plus two cases for the *include-path* walk, which is a separate traversal
# over the same :spices graph and needed its own visited set
# (docs/archive/history/spice-cycle-include-path-blowup.md):
#   4. spice-cycle-three-hop          -- a -> b -> c -> a; terminates, and
#                                        every src/ on the ring still lands on
#                                        the include path.
#   5. spice-diamond-shared-dep       -- one dep reached by two parents; the
#                                        visited set must dedupe the WALK
#                                        without pruning the include dir.
#
# The plan's third case (transitive-cmake-deps-basic, an end-to-end build
# through a sibling's :cmake-deps) is exercised by the cascade fixture in
# `../turmeric-spices/spices/tourist/tests/fixtures/cascade/` -- it is not
# replicated here because a hermetic version would need a vendored cmake
# project and a working `cmake` on the runner.

# 3. Workspace members are NOT seeded by default, and the escape hatch still

#
#    member-b does not list member-a in :spices, reaching it only through the
#    workspace :members resolution.  Both members declare the same-named
#    "fakelib" with different :refs, so seeding member-a makes the conflict
#    diagnostic fire -- which makes this fixture a precise probe for whether
#    seeding happened at all.
#
#    workspace-transitive-native-deps-plan originally seeded every member, so
#    the diagnostic was the assertion.  That was reverted: seeding all members
#    means building ONE spice configures EVERY member's native deps, which is
#    wasteful and fatal two ways -- one dep that cannot configure aborts the
#    whole build, and unrelated members collide in the single CMake target
#    namespace.  See pkg_workspace_wide_cmake_deps().  The declared :spices
#    closure (case 2 above) is the supported way to inherit a sibling's native
#    dep.  Both directions are pinned here so neither default drifts silently.

# 4/5. spice-cycle-include-path-blowup: the transitive :spices walk that unions
#      dep src/ dirs into the include path needs the same visited set the
#      :cmake-deps walk above already has. Without one, a manifest cycle
#      recursed forever -- each lap resolved through one more `../` hop, so the
#      paths never repeated textually and the output dedup never fired. It
#      surfaced as a multi-kilobyte `-I` that cc rejected with "File name too
#      long" on an unrelated system header, or as a stack overflow under ASan.
#
#      Case 1 above covers the two-spice ring. These two cover the ways a
#      too-clever fix goes wrong: a three-hop ring (which a "is this dep my
#      parent?" check would miss) and a diamond (which an over-eager visited
#      set would prune, dropping an include dir that is genuinely needed).
