# tests/run-interp-show-inline-c.sh -- a USER `Show`/`show` instance with an
# inline-C body, under --interpret.
#
# turi-show-instance-with-inline-c-body-prints-a-pointer: the interpreter's
# stdlib natives for `Show`'s inline-C numeric instances are registered under
# the elaborator's mangled instance names (`__inst_Show_show_float`, ...), and
# the "keep native override" branch in eval.c kept such a native for ANY impl
# that landed on the same key.  A user program defining its own minimal
# `(defclass Show [a] (show [x] : cstr))` with an inline-C `Show [float]` body
# therefore ran stdlib's native, which returns an owned String handle -- so
# `(println (.show 7.35))` printed the handle's address, silently, where every
# other inline-C shape the tree-walker cannot run says so.  The override is now
# kept only for an impl defined under stdlib/.
#
# This needs its OWN runner rather than a fixture: tests/run-turi.sh PASS-skips
# every program containing a user inline-C block (the TI7 carve-out), which is
# exactly why nothing caught it.
#
# What is asserted (the isolation table from the report, plus the controls).
# Rows 1-4 accept either honest outcome -- the simple executor claims the body
# and answers correctly, or the clean inline-C diagnostic with a non-zero exit
# -- and reject a bare integer (the pointer) on stdout:
#   1. Show/show  + inline-C, float receiver (unclaimed today: diagnostic).
#   2. Show/show  + inline-C, int receiver   (claimed today: `int:735`).
#   3. Show/render + inline-C                 (never broke; must not start).
#   4. P/f        + inline-C.
#   5. Show/show with a PURE body:             prints the answer, exit 0 (the
#      user `Show` path must keep working).
#   6. Compiled Show/show + inline-C:          `float:7.35` (unchanged).
#   7. stdlib's own Show under --interpret:    `show-line` on a float still
#      answers through the native (the override the fix must keep).
#
