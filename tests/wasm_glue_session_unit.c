/* wasm_glue_session_unit.c -- the playground's eval session, driven natively
 * the way Try Turmeric drives it (playground-session-hygiene-plan).
 *
 * Each case is a sequence a user reaches from the page:
 *
 *   - PS2/PS3: hovering a name in the doc panel calls turi_doc_lookup.  It
 *     used to evaluate `(doc-lookup "name")` INTO the session; doc-lookup was
 *     never defined there, so the lookup failed, returned NULL for every stdlib
 *     name, and left the session unable to re-run the program in the editor
 *     ("'main' is already defined by an auto-loaded stdlib module").  A lookup
 *     now reads the generated table from C and must find stdlib docs, find
 *     builtin docs, miss cleanly, and leave Run working however many times it
 *     is called.
 *   - PS3: `(doc ...)` at the prompt, in each spelling, evaluates cleanly.
 *   - PS5: turi_wasm_rewind_to_prelude, which Run calls first, forgets what
 *     turns defined -- at runtime too -- and keeps the stdlib and its natives.
 *
 * Nothing in wasm_glue.c is wasm-specific, so linking libturi_wasm runs the
 * real entry points.  Runs from the source root, where stdlib/ lives (the
 * browser build embeds the same tree at /stdlib).
