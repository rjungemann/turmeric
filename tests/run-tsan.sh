# tests/run-tsan.sh -- the concurrency fixtures under ThreadSanitizer.
#
# Runs tests/run.sh with TUR_TSAN=1 (every fixture program compiled with
# -fsanitize=thread) over the fixtures that exercise threads: every one that
# carries a `requires.tsan` marker -- those are skipped by an ordinary run and
# run NOWHERE else -- plus the STM, async, fiber, channel, select, future,
# mutex, atomic, scheduler and thread-pool families.  A data race is a failed
# fixture: TSan exits 66 after reporting one.
#
# Nightly in .github/workflows/tsan.yml (security-audit-plan WP5).  Locally:
#
#   cmake -S . -B build-tsan -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
#   cmake --build build-tsan -j
#   TUR=./build-tsan/tur timeout 720 bash tests/run-tsan.sh
#
# TUR must not be an ASan build (the default Debug one is): the fixture
# programs link against the runtime archives next to it, and ASan and TSan
# cannot share a process.  Release, or Debug with -DTUR_DEBUG_SANITIZE=OFF.
#
# Env:
#   TUR   compiler to test (default ./build-tsan/tur, then ./build/tur)
