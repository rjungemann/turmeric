# The bare-name constructor alias must be ABSENT whenever the name it would
# define has more than one meaning.
#
# A constructor's emitted C symbol is `ctor_<Adt>_<Ctor>`, and a constructor
# name owned by exactly one ADT additionally gets a bare `ctor_<Ctor>` macro
# alias so hand-written inline C keeps working (stdlib/either.tur documents
# `ctor_Left(v)`).  That alias must fail CLOSED: when the name is ambiguous no
# alias is emitted, so inline C naming it fails at cc pointing at the
# constructor -- rather than silently binding to whichever ADT was emitted
# first.
#
# It did not always fail closed.  The uniqueness test keyed on the RAW
# constructor name while the alias was guarded on the MANGLED one, so `b-c` and
# `b_c` in two different ADTs read as two distinct unique names, both emitted an
# alias, and the second `#define` was dropped by its own `#ifndef`.  Inline C
# calling `ctor_b_c` then reached the FIRST ADT's constructor with no diagnostic
# at any layer -- and with both ADTs on the int64 carrier, C's type system could
# not see it either.  The repro asked for a constructor at tag 0 and got tag 1.
# See docs/reported/separator-fold-collides-emitted-c-names.md.
#
# This is a harness rather than a fixture because the property is about what is
# NOT in the emitted C, and pinning that with a whole-program expected.c
# snapshot would be four thousand lines to assert one absent line.
