# RM3 R5 graduation item 2 (regions-plan.md): the static escape walk admits
# shapes ONE AT A TIME, each pinned here with its retire/rewind verdict AND its
# value read back after the pop.  This is the second batch, after the
# scalar-field ADT result that region-scope-adt-result pins.
#
# ADMITTED (must REWIND -- tur_region_pop_checked):
#   r-struct  a `defstruct` with scalar fields.  Every defstruct lowers to a
#             record ADT (structdef-retirement DS-D), so it reaches the same
#             TY_ADT arm as a `defdata` and its `[x : int y : float]` fields are
#             scalar keywords the form-based widening admits.  Nothing special
#             was built for it; this pins that it stays admitted.
#   r-cstr    a variant holding a `:cstr`.  A C string is never region memory
#             (no path routes a char buffer through the generation allocator),
#             and `cstr` is on the scalar-keyword list.
#   r-enum    a variant holding a field-less by-value enum.  The form `Color` is
#             NOT a scalar keyword, so it is admitted the other way: the field's
#             `full_type` is recorded (record_full in resolve_ctor_field) and the
#             walk descends into Color, whose every ctor is field-less and so
#             reaches nothing.  That is the inference: nothing else could have
#             let it through.
#   r-sum     a variant holding a non-recursive multi-variant SUM OF SCALARS,
#             `(Circle :float) (Sq :float :float)`.  Same route as r-enum, and
#             this is the one worth knowing the name of: adt_is_byvalue_product
#             (types.c) admits an SR1 by-value sum candidate and walks every
#             variant's fields, so `Shape` counts as "by-value product" for
#             record_full, gets a full_type, and the walk descends into it.
#
# REFUSED (must RETIRE -- tur_region_pop):
#   r-bad     a variant holding a sum ONE OF WHOSE ARMS holds a `:heap` node.
#             The walk descends into the sum and refuses at that arm: a union
#             is only as safe as its widest arm.
#   r-rec     a variant holding a SELF-RECURSIVE sum.  Its recursive field's
#             form names the def, which is never a scalar keyword, so it refuses
#             -- the spine is exactly what a rewind must not reclaim.
#   r-heap    a variant HOLDING a `:heap` node.  The result reaches region
#             memory, so the walk refuses on `is_heap`.  It is DEFINED so its
#             retire is counted, but deliberately NOT called from main: a record
#             with a `:heap` field returned through a CAPTURING generic `[A]` fat-thunk
#             bracket reads its INT field back as garbage -- with the flag off
#             too, so it is not the region's doing.  Filed as
#             docs/reported/capturing-thunk-returning-heap-field-record-garbles-int.md.
#             Running it would bake a nondeterministic pointer into this file.
#
# The counts are the ratchet: a widening that admits `r-heap` shows up as a
# changed number here AND, because a retired region reclaims nothing, could
# only ever turn into a wrong answer in the run lines below -- which is the SR4
# lesson this whole family asserts values for.  region-scope-adt-result keeps
# the mutual-recursion negative; this file does not duplicate it.
