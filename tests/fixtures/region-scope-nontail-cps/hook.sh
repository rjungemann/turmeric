# RM3 R5 graduation item 3, the CPS CT_LETCALL arm: R4 left it with NO region
# bracket, deliberately -- every probed shape lowered to CT_TAILCALL, so a copy
# there would have been untested safety code.  This pins WHY it is unreachable
# for a region-scope callee, so the arm can stay bracket-free by proof rather
# than by absence of a probe.
#
# The IR builder (cps_ir.c) emits CT_LETCALL only for an UNCOLORED callee; a
# colored callee always becomes CT_TAILCALL (with a join continuation when the
# call is not in tail position).  Both region scopes -- bt-scope and
# with-region -- are colored, because each invokes a fat thunk.  So a region
# bracket can never land on the LETCALL arm.
#
# Asserted here with `with-region` (the newer of the two; R4 probed bt-scope)
# in the two NON-tail positions that would produce a LETCALL for an uncolored
# callee -- let-bound and used, and as an arithmetic operand -- inside a
# function that is CPS-lowered (its __cps twin is emitted).  Both calls must
# carry a bracket, and the values must survive.
