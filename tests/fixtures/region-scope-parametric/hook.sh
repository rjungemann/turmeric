# RM3 R5 graduation item 2, fifth batch: PARAMETRIC results.  The static
# escape walk used to refuse every TY_APP but `(Vec <scalar>)` on sight; it
# now (a) substitutes a monomorph's type arguments into its field types before
# asking whether a field reaches a node, and (b) treats the four malloc-backed
# collections (Vec / Map / Set / MutableMap) as reaching exactly what their
# ELEMENT types reach.  One shape per defn, each pinned by its retire/rewind
# verdict AND its value read back after the pop -- the SR4 lesson: a rewind
# of something still live prints stale words here, never a link error.
#
# ADMITTED (must REWIND -- tur_region_pop_checked):
#   p-pair   `(Pair int int)`: stdlib's defstruct Pair [A B] with A, B := int;
#            the substituted fields are scalars.
#   p-opt    `(Option int)`: a parametric SUM -- every ctor's substituted
#            fields are walked; `(Some :A)` with A := int reaches nothing.
#   p-nest   `(Pair (Pair int int) int)`: the def is its own type argument.
#            Arguments are walked BEFORE the def goes on the cycle path, so
#            nesting is not read as a cycle; the by-value child sits in a
#            plain-malloc box (the byval<->carrier field bridge).
#   v-pair   `(Vec (Pair int int))`: a Vec of BY-VALUE AGGREGATES.  The push
#            bridge boxes each element with plain malloc; the box reaches what
#            the pair's fields reach, which is nothing.
#   m-int    `(Map int int)`: handle and HAMT nodes are inline-C / runtime
#            malloc (map.tur, src/runtime/hamt.c); int64 keys and values.
#   s-int    `(Set int)`: same, set.tur.
#
# REFUSED (must RETIRE -- tur_region_pop):
#   p-link   `(Pair Link int)`: the substituted `fst` IS the `:heap` node.
#   o-link   `(Option Link)`: same, through a sum.
#   m-link   `(Map int Link)`: the HAMT's values are pointers into the
#            generation.
#
# The retired shapes are RUN too (their values are identical to the flag-off
# program by construction); the counts are the ratchet.
