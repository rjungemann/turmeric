# RM3 R5 graduation item 2, fourth batch: a `Vec` of SCALARS returned from a
# region bracket REWINDS -- the plan's own named example of an over-
# conservative refusal ("a bracket returning a Vec of scalars never rewinds").
#
# Why it was refused: a parametric monomorph `(Vec int)` is a TY_APP, so it
# never reached the walk's TY_ADT arm and fell to `default:`.  Why it is safe
# to admit, one reason per lock:
#   (1) Vec's OWN storage -- handle and element buffer -- is plain inline-C
#       malloc in stdlib/vec.tur, never the region router (which is emitted
#       only at the four ADT-ctor sites).  So the escaping handle is never
#       region memory: the runtime lock (tur_region_note_escape) is satisfied.
#       A compiler-warranted name check, the option-niche plan's warrant.
#   (2) The ELEMENTS are what could reach, and a scalar element is an int64
#       word in that malloc'd buffer: nothing to reach.
#
# What it must NOT admit (the negative): a Vec of `:heap` nodes.  Its buffer
# holds pointers INTO the generation, so the walk refuses on the element and
# the bracket retires -- byte-for-byte the flag-off program, safe to run.
#
# The SR4 lesson, with more force than usual: the elements are read back
# AFTER the pop.  A rewind that reclaimed the buffer (or a Vec whose storage
# had quietly become region-routed) would print stale words here, not a link
# error -- and under the Debug poison would trap.  So the values, not merely
# the build, are the assertion.
