# RM3 R5 graduation item 3, the pooled slab: a reclaimed generation is REWOUND,
# not released -- region.c pools the arena for the next push -- so at exit one
# 64 KiB slab per pooled arena was reachable but never freed.  tur_region_shutdown
# frees live, retired and pooled arenas; this pins WHERE it is registered,
# because the first attempt put it in the wrong place and a probe caught it.
#
# atexit runs LIFO, so shutdown must be REGISTERED BEFORE every module `defer`
# -- a defer may read a value that ESCAPED its bracket, which lives in a RETIRED
# generation, and freeing first is a use-after-free.  Registering it in a main
# prologue is too late: a __attribute__((constructor)) runs __tur_static_init
# (and so registers the defers) before main, and that attempt read 0 where 42
# was right, with valgrind's "Invalid read".  The only always-earlier place is
# the first statement of __tur_static_init itself, behind its idempotent guard.
#
# Three assertions, and the third is the one that matters:
#   1. PLACEMENT: in the emitted C, atexit(tur_region_shutdown) appears inside
#      __tur_static_init, AFTER `__tur_static_init_done = 1` and BEFORE the
#      call to __module_defers_init -- and NOT in main.
#   2. GATING: with the flag off, the program references no region symbol.
#   3. VALUE: at run time the module defer prints the escaped node's field,
#      42, read from a retired generation BEFORE shutdown frees it.  A wrong
#      order does not leak -- it prints 0 (or traps under the Debug poison).
#      That is the SR4 lesson again: assert the value, not the build.
