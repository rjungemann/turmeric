# region-bracket-lost-when-bt-scope-specializes / region-walk-refuses-every-adt-result:
# a `bt-scope` whose result is an ADT must OPEN a region, must hand back a value
# that outlives the pop, and must rewind exactly the shapes the static walk can
# prove -- no more.
#
# Three things this asserts that an output-only fixture cannot:
#
#   1. The bracket EXISTS.  A non-scalar result made the call resolve to an ABI
#      specialization and take the CPS emitter's `/* cps->cps */` arm, which
#      carries no push/pop -- so the program compiled, ran, printed the right
#      answer, and silently never opened a region.  Zero diagnostic, zero
#      output difference.  Only the emitted C shows it, so that is what is
#      grepped.
#
#   2. The retire/rewind SPLIT is exactly the proven set.  `pick` returns a
#      field-less enum -- by value, reaches nothing -- and must REWIND
#      (tur_region_pop_checked); this is the shape the bare-TY_ADT lookup
#      admitted, and it retired before that change.  `one-round` returns
#      `(RIP :int :int)`, which the walk still cannot prove (an ordinary `:int`
#      field records no full_type), and `mutual` returns a spine reached through
#      a cycle: both must RETIRE (tur_region_pop).  The counts are asserted, so
#      a widening that admits `RIP` shows up here as a changed number to be
#      read, not a silent gain -- and a widening that admits `mutual` shows up
#      as a wrong answer in (3).
#
#   3. The values SURVIVE.  This is the SR4 lesson, and the reclamation plan
#      says it applies to regions with more force: a fixture that only checks
#      the program builds would pass with a rewind that reclaimed memory still
#      in use, because the wrong answer is a stale read, not a link error.
#      `mutual` is the case that actually produced one during this work -- a
#      mutually-recursive result whose spine a kind-based field accept wrongly
#      proved safe, printing 0 instead of 42.
