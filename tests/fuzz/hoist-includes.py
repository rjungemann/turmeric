"""hoist-includes.py -- apply the driver's __tur_include__ hoist to emitted C.

`tur build` scans the C it generated for `/* __tur_include__: LINE */` markers
and prepends each LINE at file scope (hoist_tur_include_directives in
src/main.c): preprocessor directives first, then code payloads such as
httpd's `HttpdConn` typedef, each bucket in source order, behind a
`#define _DEFAULT_SOURCE 1`.  `tur emit-c` prints the C before that step, so a
fuzz harness that #includes emitted C for a module with markers
(stdlib/httpd.tur) needs the same step applied.  This is that step, and
nothing else.

usage: hoist-includes.py <in.c> <out.c>
