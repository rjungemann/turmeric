# tests/run-sr4-seam.sh -- keep the SR4 seam's green state from rotting.
#
# Recursive sums (Term, Subst, Stream, Regex, ...) flow BY VALUE by default
# since RM4 (2026-09-02; see the is_self_recursive test in src/compiler/types.c
# and the SR plan's SR4 section).  TUR_SR4_RECURSIVE_CARRIER=1 restores the
# int64 carrier for A/B measurement, which means nothing in the ordinary suite
# ever compiles a recursive sum through the carrier any more.  A gate nobody
# turns on decays to a gate nobody notices (the lesson of
# docs/reported/sanitizer-gate-not-armed-in-ci.md); this harness keeps the
# carrier path green as the compiler moves, so the A/B stays a one-line
# switch instead of a re-excavation.  (Before the flip it kept the by-value
# path green the same way; the population below is unchanged.)
#
# Two checks:
#   1. A CANARY: emit-c of a logic fixture must show the carrier ctor
#      signature (`static int64_t ctor_Subst_SBind(`).  By value the same ctor
#      returns tur_adt_Subst, so if the env var is ever renamed or the gate
#      stops reading it, this harness fails LOUDLY instead of silently
#      re-testing the default path.
#   2. Every fixture below -- the recursive-sum population plus the SR1/fat-ABI
#      fixtures the seam must not perturb -- builds and prints its committed
#      expected.stdout with the seam ON.
#
# Exit status: 0 if all checks pass, 1 otherwise.
