# tests/run-regions-seam.sh -- keep the regions OFF path from rotting, now
# that regions are the default.
#
# INVERTED at graduation (2026-09-05), per the flags guide's rule: when a
# feature graduates, the path it STOPPED being becomes the path nothing
# compiles any more.  Before the flip this harness ran the spine-carrying and
# bracket-carrying population with `--enable=regions` and asserted output
# equality against the flag-off run, so the R2 routing and the R4 brackets
# could not change an answer.  Since 2026-09-05 every `bash tests/run.sh`
# compiles that population WITH regions -- so this harness now runs it with
# `TUR_REGIONS=0`, the bisection hatch that restores the pre-graduation
# build: plain malloc at the four routed ctor sites, no bracket around
# bt-scope / with-region, no atexit shutdown.  A hatch nobody turns on decays
# into a hatch nobody notices (run-sr4-seam.sh's lesson, and the SR2 seam that
# rotted for want of exactly this); keeping the OFF path green is what makes a
# bisection a one-variable switch instead of a re-excavation.
#
# Two checks, mirroring run-option-niche-seam.sh:
#   1. A CANARY: under TUR_REGIONS=0, emit-c of region-scope-value-survives
#      must reference NO region symbol at all -- every region emission (the
#      preamble externs, the ctor routing, the bracket, the atexit) is gated on
#      the one predicate the hatch clears, so a single `tur_region_` in the
#      output means the env var was renamed or the gate stopped reading it,
#      and this fails LOUDLY instead of silently re-testing the default.  The
#      positive control -- the same file emitted on the default -- must open a
#      region, so a harness that could never see a bracket is caught too.
#   2. The population, compiled and RUN with regions OFF against each fixture's
#      committed expected.stdout -- which is the DEFAULT-ON expectation, so
#      this is also the output-equality assertion the pre-flip harness made,
#      with the arms swapped.
#
# `region-scope-adt-result`, `-shapes`, `-vec-scalar`, `-nontail-cps` and
# `region-shutdown-order` are deliberately NOT listed: they are hook-driven
# (no input.tur for this loop) and each hook already runs BOTH arms itself,
# with TUR_REGIONS=0 as its off arm.
#
# Exit status: 0 if all checks pass, 1 otherwise.
