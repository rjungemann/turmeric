#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/run-sr2-seam.sh -- keep the SR2 seam's OFF path from rotting, now that
# by-value parametric sums are the default.
#
# A MULTI-VARIANT PARAMETRIC sum monomorph ((Opt2 int), (PRes cstr), and above
# all (Option A) / (Result A B)) flows BY VALUE by default since
# parametric-sum-byvalue graduated on 2026-08-27
# (docs/upcoming/sum-representation-plan.md SR2c).  TUR_SR2_APP_SUM_BYVALUE=0
# restores the int64 carrier for bisection -- which means nothing in the
# ordinary suite compiles a parametric sum through the carrier any more.  A gate
# nobody turns on decays to a gate nobody notices (the lesson of
# docs/reported/sanitizer-gate-not-armed-in-ci.md); this harness keeps the
# carrier path green so a bisection stays a switch instead of a re-excavation.
#
# This file is the mirror image of the harness of the same name that was RETIRED
# at graduation, and it inherits that harness's M7 population unchanged.
# Retiring it was the one thing the graduation got wrong.  The reasoning on
# record -- "every `bash tests/run.sh` compiles all eleven of its fixtures that
# way" now -- is true, and covers the ON path; it just leaves the OFF path with
# no cover at all, which is the state the harness had been built to prevent with
# the two paths swapped.  Both sibling seams took the other branch and FLIPPED
# their harness rather than deleting it (run-sr4-seam.sh, and
# run-option-niche-seam.sh: "Before the flip it kept the niche path green the
# same way").
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS HARNESS SETS TWO ENV VARS, NOT ONE
#
# TUR_SR2_APP_SUM_BYVALUE=0 is NOT a one-variable switch, and that is a finding
# of this harness rather than a design anyone wrote down.  SR3's Option niche
# (TUR_OPTION_NICHE, default ON since 2026-09-03) is layered ON TOP of by-value
# parametric sums: it narrows an eligible `(Option P)` to its payload pointer,
# a representation that only exists because SR2 put the sum by value in the
# first place.  Turning SR2 off underneath a live niche pulls the rug out --
# measured 2026-09-04, six fixtures, four of them a COMPILER ABORT rather than
# a diagnostic (inline-c-option-byval-param, inline-c-carrier-producer-byval-
# positions, option-niche-string, option-niche-vec-closure-cmp) and one a
# silent wrong answer (httpd-req-string-opt).  All six recover when the niche
# comes off too.
#
# So the only coherent bisection mode is BOTH hatches down, and that is what
# this harness pins.  Anyone reaching for TUR_SR2_APP_SUM_BYVALUE=0 alone gets
# a crash whose cause is two layers away from the switch they flipped; see
# docs/reported/sr2-carrier-seam-rotted.md.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two checks, mirroring run-sr4-seam.sh and run-option-niche-seam.sh:
#   1. A CANARY: emit-c of parsec-tutorial under the seam must show the CARRIER
#      ctor signature (`static int64_t ctor_PRes_POK__*`).  By value the same
#      ctor returns its monomorph, so if the env var is ever renamed or the gate
#      stops reading it, this harness fails LOUDLY instead of silently
#      re-testing the default path.  (The ctor is spelled `ctor_PRes_POK__*` --
#      ADT-qualified, with a `ctor_POK` alias #define -- not the bare
#      `ctor_POK__*` the retired ON-path harness matched.  That rename is itself
#      evidence of the rot: the old canary regex matches nothing today, so a
#      naive un-retirement would have passed its canary vacuously.)
#   2. Every fixture below builds and prints its committed expected.stdout with
#      the seam ON.  VALUES, not just the build: this whole family's failures
#      hide behind function-pointer casts that cc cannot see through, and the
#      acceptance test (parsec-tutorial) has a history of building cleanly and
#      then SEGV'ing.
#
# NOT a snapshot check.  `TUR_SR2_APP_SUM_BYVALUE=0 bash tests/run.sh` reports
# ~157 failures, ~148 of which are `expected.c` codegen mismatches -- the
# snapshots are committed for the DEFAULT representation, so of course they move
# when the representation does.  That is noise, not signal, and it is why this
# harness compares stdout the way its retired ancestor did.
#
# Exit status: 0 if all checks pass, 1 otherwise.

# --- 2. The population, compiled and RUN under the carrier. ----------------
# Part A -- inherited verbatim from the retired ON-path harness (the M7
# worklist).  These are USER parametric sums, and they were the whole
# population when the seam ran the other way:
#   hkt-cata-*: the fixpoint-functor carrier family (ExprF/Expr, ReF/Re).
#   hkt-fmap-byvalue-sum-element: a Functor instance over a parametric sum,
#     monomorphised per result element -- the discriminating probe reads the
#     SECOND child, so a layout mismatch shows up as a wrong value.
#   class-method-hkt-tyvar-grounding: a method-level tyvar in result position,
#     and the nested-ctor field channel -- the inner `(None)` of `(Some (None))`.
#   conv-with-narrowed-variant-parametric: the let use-site look-ahead -- an
#     unannotated `(Empty)` grounded from a later `(getv e)`.
#   poly-combinator-application-element-inference: a closure lifted out of a
#     POLYMORPHIC combinator, cloned per instantiation so its dispatch is typed.
#     Pins a non-zero expected.exit.
#   parsec-tutorial: the gate document's acceptance test.  PRes is the Option
#     shape verbatim, driven through parser-combinator closures.
#
# Part B -- the post-SR2b population, which the retired harness could not have
# had.  Its eleven fixtures were chosen when Option and Result were still
# discriminated records, so the seam only ever moved user ADTs.  SR2b made the
# two most-used types in the language the population, and THAT is what the OFF
# path now has to carry: the by-value/carrier Option and Result crossings, the
# `?` operator, inline-C builders straddling the boundary, catch-unwind returns,
# typeclass and HKT instances over both, and the niche fixtures that still work
# with both hatches down.

# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED -- red under the seam as of 2026-09-04, both filed in
# docs/reported/sr2-carrier-seam-rotted.md.  They are left out rather than
# carried red so this harness answers "has the carrier path rotted FURTHER",
# which is the question it exists to answer.  Re-add each as its defect closes.
#
#   sum-passthrough-param-not-dropped -- a hard C compile error under the seam
#     ("invalid initializer", an aggregate bound from a carrier match slot).
#     Fails with the niche off OR on, so it is the carrier path's own rot and
#     not the layering above.
#   option-niche-vec-closure-cmp -- a SILENT wrong answer, and the sharper of
#     the two: it passes with the niche off alone, so TUR_SR2_APP_SUM_BYVALUE=0
#     is what breaks it.  run-option-niche-seam.sh carries it green on its own
