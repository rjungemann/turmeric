# built under AddressSanitizer and checked for BOTH leaks (live rc blocks once
# the scope has closed) and memory errors.

# The fixture suite pins the common shapes; this pins the whole matrix under a
# sanitizer, including the two that deliberately still leak. Opt-in: a sanitized
# compile per case is slow.

# Exit status: 0 if every case holds, 1 otherwise.
