# Windows Support -- Remaining Work

**Status (revised 2026-09-04):** WIN0 (compiler/runtime), WIN1 (generated-code
portability), and the hard core of WIN3 (async I/O + fiber context switches) are
done and **merged to `main`** -- squash-merged as `7a16ef1de` ("Windows Bringup
(#682)").

**The `windows-bringup` branch is live again, and is where the current work is.**
An earlier revision of this header said it was "~900 commits behind main; do not
work from it" -- that was true when written and is no longer. It has since been
merged up twice (most recently 584 commits, v0.33.2 -> v0.43.0) and carries the
JIT bring-up, the `__builtin_setjmp` fiber fix, the `-ldl` autolink fix, and the
CI change below.

`tur.exe` builds under MSYS2/UCRT64, and `tur build` compiles and runs real
programs. Measured on `windows-bringup` with gcc 16.1.0, Debug:

```
TUR=./build-win/tur.exe bash tests/run.sh
# summary: 2781 passed, 0 failed
```

**Do not trust a green local run until it is green on a machine that has never
run the suite.** That number was first measured on a box that happened to have
`C:	mp` left over from earlier runs; the same commit came back `2769 passed, 12
failed` on a clean CI runner whose workspace is on `D:`. A dozen fixtures (and
stdlib's `fs/tmpfile`) spell `/tmp/...` literally, and a NATIVE Windows binary
resolves that against the current drive root, not the MSYS shell's `/tmp`.
`tests/run.sh` now provisions `<drive>:	mp`; the real fix is tracked in
[windows-hardcoded-tmp-resolves-to-drive-root](../../reported/windows-hardcoded-tmp-resolves-to-drive-root.md).

Run the suite against a **Debug** build. A Release `tur` compiles out contract
checks (`rt_contracts_emitted` is `#ifdef NDEBUG`), so every fixture pinning a
contract panic fails against it with the wrong runtime error -- which looks
exactly like a product regression and is not one.

The remaining known-bad fixtures PASS-skip behind markers rather than sitting
red, so a new failure is unambiguous:

| marker | what it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `requires.posix-apis` | POSIX-only APIs (11 fixtures) -- pipe-fd reactor family, `childhandle`, `term-raw-cooked` |
| `requires.win64-aggregate-abi` | the SysV-vs-Win64 aggregate-return threshold ([report](../../reported/win64-aggregate-return-threshold-is-sysv.md)) |

**WIN0 regressed between the merge and 2026-07-31 and had to be re-fixed.** Five
independent breaks accumulated, three of them within five days, because nothing
guarded Windows in CI. The compiler did not build at all. See
`docs/reported/windows-*.md` and the `fix(windows): restore the Windows build on
main` commit.

**That guard now exists, and as of this branch it runs the fixture suite, not
just the build.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has a `windows` job (MSYS2/UCRT64).
It was build-only by deliberate choice while ~54 fixtures were failing -- a
permanently-red job teaches people to ignore it -- with the stated exit
condition "turn the suite on here once those classes are closed". They are
closed, so it is on.

Build-only was not sufficient, and the gap was not hypothetical: `-ldl` (Windows
has no libdl) reached main in three new `jit-ffi` fixtures and the job stayed
green through it, because that failure is a LINK error when building a FIXTURE,
not when building `tur.exe`.

Still missing: `release.yml` ships no Windows artifact, and
`src/CMakeLists.txt:45-49` disables `-Werror` on Windows pending a warning-clean
port, so the job runs with warnings unpromoted.

This plan tracks what is left.

The original end-to-end plan (toolchain rationale, the WIN0/WIN1 blockers, the
Wine loop, the full WIN3 investigation) is archived at
[docs/archive/windows-support-plan.md](../../archive/windows-support-plan.md).

**Toolchain:** MinGW-w64 / UCRT64 via MSYS2 (`C:\msys64`), not Clang-cl. Build
with `just build-windows`; run the suite with
`TUR=./build-win/tur.exe bash tests/run.sh` (it derives the libturi `-L` from
`$TUR` and exports `TUR_BIND_LOOPBACK=1` so socket fixtures don't trip the
firewall).

## WIN2 -- `turmeric-godot` GDExtension Windows build (THE north star -- LOADS)

**Goal:** build the shim from `../turmeric-godot/` as a Windows `.dll` and load
it in a stock Godot 4 binary. This is the actual point of Windows support -- the
compiler/runtime work exists to serve it.

**Reached 2026-08-04.** The shim builds as
`libturmeric-godot.windows.template_debug.x86_64.dll` and initializes in a stock
Godot 4.3.stable:

```
$ scons platform=windows arch=x86_64 target=template_debug use_mingw=yes
$ Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe --headless --editor --path examples/spike --quit
[turmeric-godot] initialize(level=2)
[turmeric-godot] ctor called
[turmeric-godot] registered Turmeric script language + resource format
[turmeric-godot] initialize(level=3)
```

Startup and shutdown are both clean (exit 0, full uninitialize sequence). The
link used `-Wl,--no-undefined`, so nothing is left unresolved.

Three notes for whoever picks this up:

- **Use `--editor`, not plain `--headless --path`.** Without it Godot goes into
  run mode, bails with "no main scene defined", and never loads the extension at
  all -- which reads exactly like a load failure. The spike project's own header
  comment still recommends the plain form.
- **Headless Godot 4.3 hangs at teardown on this box**, with
  `Pages in use exist at exit in PagedAllocator`. Verified as NOT ours: an empty
  project with no GDExtension hangs identically. Wrap runs in a `timeout`.
- **One error remains**, and it is an ordering problem rather than a load
  failure: `[turmeric-godot] TurmericEditorSyntaxHighlighter class not
  registered; is the GDExtension loaded?` is pushed *before* `initialize(level=2)`.
  The editor plugin in `addons/turmeric-godot-editor` runs ahead of the
  extension's EDITOR-level registration. Not known to be Windows-specific --
  untested on Linux/macOS.

What is NOT yet demonstrated: **the AOT path has never run.** Loading the
extension does not compile a `.tur` script, so the Windows-specific work in
`aot_cache.cpp` (cmd.exe quoting, `std::system` exit decoding, `.dll` cache
naming) is still unexercised. That needs a project that actually attaches a
Turmeric script.

### Prerequisite in this repo: shared-library output naming -- DONE

`tur build --shared` emits `<name>.dll` (no `lib` prefix) on Windows.
`TUR_SHLIB_PREFIX` / `TUR_SHLIB_EXT` in `src/platform_fs.h` are the single
source of truth; `src/main.c` (default output path) and
`src/turi/spice_loader.c` (the `.tur-repl-cache/` image) both build their names
from them. macOS deliberately keeps `lib<name>.so` -- see the header comment.

`tests/run-build-shared.sh` passes 11/11 against `build-win/tur.exe`: the .dll
links, exports `smokelib__add42`, dlopens through `src/platform_dl.h`, calls,
and writes `exports.manifest`. Three fixes were needed to get there:

- **Multi-TU collision in the emitted ucontext shim.** The WIN3-C register-
  snapshot shim goes into *every* generated TU with `.globl __tur_uctx_swap` /
  `__tur_uctx_tramp`, so any build with more than one TU died with "multiple
  definition". Not `--shared`-specific: every multi-module `tur build <dir>`
  hits it; `--shared` just always has a second TU (`tur_runtime.c`). The
  definitions now sit in COMDAT (`.text$<name>` + `.linkonce discard`), the
  mechanism a C++ inline function uses. Two traps: `.scl 3` alone is not enough
  for `__tur_uctx_swap` (the C code calls it, so GCC re-externalises it), and
  the asm block **must** end by switching back to `.text` -- otherwise later
  compiler output lands in the discardable section and every generated program
  segfaults in `main()`.
- **`basename_of()` split on `/` only.** Windows `realpath()` returns the
  backslash spelling, so `tur build --shared .` used the whole absolute path as
  the artifact name and ld rejected it. Now splits on `\` too, under `_WIN32`.
- **`dlfcn.h` in the smoke harness.** MinGW has none; it now includes the
  repo's existing `src/platform_dl.h`.

Nine harnesses also hardcoded `TUR="./build/tur"` rather than honouring a `TUR`
override, so they could not be pointed at `build-win/tur.exe` at all. They now
read `${TUR:-./build/tur}` like the other 35.

Still open: confirm the shim's "compile script on demand" subprocess invokes
`tur.exe` (with the suffix). `tur_settle_exe_output` already handles the
executable case.

### Scope (mostly in `../turmeric-godot/`)

- Add `windows` arch targets to the `SConstruct`.
- Statically link the WIN0/WIN1 `libturi` artifact (`build-win/src/libturi.a`),
  and its Windows link deps: `ws2_32`, `shlwapi`, `pthread` (winpthreads).
- Update `turmeric-godot.gdextension` with `windows.debug.x86_64` /
  `windows.release.x86_64` entries.
- Cache directory: prefer the in-project `<project>/.godot/turmeric-cache/`
  (cross-platform, Godot already creates `.godot/`).

### Testing

- Build `examples/spike` on a `windows-latest` runner (Godot ships a headless
  Windows binary). Confirm `[turmeric-godot] initialize(level=...)` in the log.
- Run the paddle-pong demo headless in CI as a smoke test once it lands.

### Open question -- shim toolchain on the user's box

When `tur build --shared` runs inside the GDExtension, which C compiler does it
invoke? Godot on Windows is MSVC-built, but GDExtension is a C ABI and godot-cpp
supports `use_mingw=yes`, so a MinGW-built shim + MinGW `tur` is expected to
work. Bundling a known-good toolchain vs. requiring MSYS2 on the user's machine
is the main UX decision. (This is why the port stayed on MinGW rather than
Clang-cl -- see the archived plan.)

## WIN3 tail -- the async fixtures still failing

None of these block WIN2; they are the long tail of the async subset.

### Pipe-fd fixtures: do not build, and would not poll either (9 fixtures)

`reactor-fd-*`, `reactor-fibers-cancel-on-free`, `reactor-fibers-park-fd`,
`reactor-stop-from-callback`, `reactor-wake-cross-thread`, `scheduler-io-park`
create a `pipe()` and register the pipe fds with the reactor.

**Correction (2026-07-31): these fail at `cc`, not at runtime.** MinGW does not
declare `pipe()` -- it ships `_pipe`, with a different signature -- and
`-Wimplicit-function-declaration` is a hard error on gcc >= 14. No reactor code
is reached. See `docs/archive/windows-pipe-reactor-fixtures-do-not-build.md`.

The runtime limitation below is still real and still applies the moment they do
compile, so the two causes compound rather than compete: **Windows `select()` is
socket-only** -- it cannot poll pipe or file fds at all, so the select-based
backend (`src/async/io_iocp.c`) cannot service them.

Options, in rough order of effort:
1. Accept as a platform limit (Godot scripts don't poll pipes). Mark the fixtures
   `requires.*`-skip on Windows.
2. Route `pipe()` through a loopback socket pair AND `read`/`write` through
   `recv`/`send` for those fds -- intricate, collides with file I/O, fragile.
   Only worth it if a real turmeric-godot use case needs pipe-style async.

Recommendation: option 1 unless a use case forces option 2.

### Concurrency stdout mismatches (2 fixtures)

`fiber-effect` and `p19-8-fiber-effect-chain` build and run but produce
diverging output -- scheduler/timing under the select backend, not yet
diagnosed. Worth a focused diagnosis pass; start by comparing fiber/worker
scheduling order against Linux.

(An earlier revision named `httpd-h4-keepalive`, `httpd-h6-routing` and
`taskgroup-async` here. All three now pass -- the first two were collateral of
the Winsock `setsockopt` build failure, not a scheduler difference.)

---

## Winsock / POSIX gaps in the stdlib

Found 2026-07-31. Not regressions: these predate the bring-up or were missed by
it.

- **`setsockopt`/`getsockopt` against Winsock (~40 fixtures) -- RESOLVED.** The
  whole `httpd-*` / `httpd-async-*` family failed to build: Winsock declares the
  option value as `char *` rather than `void *`. Fixed in the emitter's Winsock
  compat shim (`emit_winsock_compat_shim`), which already remapped
  `socket`/`fcntl`/`recv`/`send`/`accept`/`connect`/`close` and was simply
  missing these two -- so every current and future POSIX-shaped call in any
  inline-C is covered, not just the three sites in `stdlib/httpd.tur`. Two
  subtleties handled there rather than per call site: `SO_RCVTIMEO`/`SO_SNDTIMEO`
  take a DWORD of milliseconds, not a `struct timeval` (a plain cast sets a
  garbage timeout), and `SO_REUSEADDR` is *dropped* on Windows because its
  meaning inverts -- Winsock's permits binding over a LIVE socket. See
  [docs/archive/windows-httpd-setsockopt-winsock.md](../../archive/windows-httpd-setsockopt-winsock.md).
- **POSIX-only inline-C (5 fixtures).** `_mkdir` (3), `ioctl`/`struct winsize`
  (1), `fork`/`getppid` (1). The `_mkdir` case is **not** a source bug --
  `stdlib/fs.tur` is correctly written with `#ifdef _WIN32` /
  `#include <direct.h>`. The include hoister
  (`tur_hoist_top_includes_scan`, `src/compiler/emit_core.c:3005`) consumes only
  blank lines, `//` comments, `#include` and object-like `#define` at the top of
  an inline-C body and stops at anything else -- including `/* */` comments and
  `#ifdef`. So a platform-conditional include is never lifted to file scope, and
  because an in-body include is block-scoped AND the header's include guard makes
  the *second* function's copy expand to nothing, the next function that needs it
  sees an implicit declaration. That is precisely the class the hoister exists to
  fix (see its own `#define`-hoisting comment), just an unhandled gap in it.
  Fixing it generally -- lift a top-of-body conditional block verbatim when it
  contains only includes/defines/comments -- also unblocks the natural port of
  `term/width`/`term/height`, which would otherwise break the same way the moment
  their `#include <sys/ioctl.h>` is wrapped in an `#ifdef`. See
  [docs/archive/windows-posix-inline-c-gaps.md](../../archive/windows-posix-inline-c-gaps.md).

## Subprocess and shared-library layers (not fixture-visible)

The commands that shell out or produce/load a shared library are unported:
`tur install`, `tur fetch`, `tur new`, and REPL spice loading. They pass
`/bin/sh` command strings with single-quote quoting to `cmd.exe`, and the REPL
JIT module graph hits the deliberate `symlink` `ENOSYS` stub. This is the
highest-impact group
for an actual Windows user and is a prerequisite for WIN2 above. See
[docs/reported/windows-subprocess-and-shared-lib-gaps.md](../../reported/windows-subprocess-and-shared-lib-gaps.md).

---

## Codegen defects the port surfaced (NOT Windows-specific)

- **Carrier<->pointer straddles (5 fixtures).** Generated C trips
  `-Wint-conversion` / `-Wincompatible-pointer-types`, hard errors on gcc >= 14
  and Apple clang >= 15. **Correction (2026-07-31): the `-Wno-error=`
  workaround this plan previously cited is gone** -- both downgrades were
  deliberately removed (`src/main.c:5231-5251`) on the grounds that every
  straddle was bridged at emit time. Five remained under gcc 16.1.0, so that
  claim did not hold; do not re-add the downgrades, the removal is what exposed
  them.

  **Update (2026-08-01): four of the five are fixed and archived** --
  [docs/archive/macos-int-conversion-carrier-pointer-straddles.md](../../archive/macos-int-conversion-carrier-pointer-straddles.md)
  (not macOS-specific despite the filename -- it is "any toolchain new enough";
  verified on Apple clang 21, which promotes `-Wint-conversion` the same way
  gcc >= 14 does). The fifth, `data-literal-nested`, was never a straddle but a
  wrong-monomorph selection that gcc's promoted `-Wincompatible-pointer-types`
  catches and clang's does not; re-filed as
  [docs/archive/vec-empty-like-monomorph-selects-int-element.md](../../archive/vec-empty-like-monomorph-selects-int-element.md)
  and **also fixed** (2026-08-01), so all five of this class should now build
  under gcc >= 14 -- unverified on Windows, since the fixes were made and
  measured on Apple clang 21. The older gcc-14 reports are resolved and archived
  under `docs/archive/history/`.
- **`-O0` link failure -- RESOLVED.** Generated C referenced
  `tur_get_contract_handler` / `tur_set_contract_handler` with no definition.
  Both are now defined in `src/runtime/contract_handler.c:21,30`.

---

## WIN4 -- standalone CLI polish (deferred)

Not required for turmeric-godot; do only if a standalone Windows CLI workflow is
wanted.

- **Coloured diagnostics:** `src/compiler/diag.c` -> `_isatty(_fileno(stderr))`
  plus `SetConsoleMode(ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING)` on Win10+.
- **REPL:** MSYS2 ships wineditline, so line editing already works; nothing to do
  unless targeting a non-MSYS2 build.
- **Release packaging:** add `windows-x86_64` to `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
  producing a `.zip` (the other targets ship `.tar.gz`). The binary links two
  non-system DLLs -- `/ucrt64/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll` and `/ucrt64/bin/edit.dll`
  (libedit, and hence the REPL's line editing) -- so either bundle them in the
  zip or link statically; a bare `tur.exe` will not start on a machine without
  MSYS2. Confirm by unzipping with MSYS2 off `PATH` and running `tur --version`.
  Make sure the runner installs `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libedit`, or the build
  quietly succeeds and ships a REPL with no line editing.

---

## Out of scope

ARM64 Windows (no free CI runner), WSL (runs the Linux build already), WASM
(separate Emscripten build), in-engine REPL on Windows.
