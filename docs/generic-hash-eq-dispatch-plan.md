# Generic `Hash` / `Eq` Dispatch -- Approach A for typed map keys (GHE0--GHE5)

>      `Hash[float32]` and is recorded as an exact match (no `TUR_E0020`).
>   2. **ABI-only specialization.** A spec is created only when
>      `abi_changes` is true (`emit_module.c:374`). An `int` key == the int64_t
>      carrier, so *no* spec is made and the call uses the polymorphic **base

## Why this is more than a one-line emission fix

GMK0 was probed during the GMK work and turned out to be **two distinct gaps**,
both reproduced on `claude/blissful-mccarthy-xiF8C` (2026-05-31):

### Gap 1 -- `Hash` / `Show` classes are not in scope by default

The auto-load list in `src/main.c` (`stdlib_files[]`, ~line 628) loads only the
*stub* typeclass modules -- `typeclass-eq.tur`, `typeclass-functor.tur`,
`typeclass-clone.tur` -- so that typed-collection `definstance`s have those
classes in scope. The **full `typeclass.tur`** -- which declares `Hash`, `Show`,
`Num`, `Ord` *and* their primitive instances (`Hash[int]`, `Hash[cstr]`,
`Hash[bool]`, `Hash[float32]`) -- is explicitly **not** auto-loaded ("remains
on-demand", comment at `src/main.c:643`).

Consequence: `(.hash 5)` and `(.show 5)` fail with *"no typeclass method found"*
(`elab_typeclasses.c:2784`) because the class is unregistered, while `(.clone 5)`
and `(.eq? 1 2)` dispatch fine (their stub classes are auto-loaded). And
`(load "stdlib/typeclass.tur")` does **not** work around it: typeclass.tur
re-defines `Clone`/`Eq`/`Functor` instances that the stubs already emitted,
producing C `redefinition of '__inst_Clone_clone_int'` errors.

### Gap 2 -- bare-name typeclass calls are never dispatched

Even for an auto-loaded class, a **bare** `(method args...)` call is not routed
to instance dispatch. Evidence:

- `(eq? 1 2)` (Eq is auto-loaded) elaborates to something typed `:int`, not
  `:bool` -- `if`-condition then rejects it (*"if condition must be bool, got
  int"*). It resolved via the eval-mode "assume native" fallback, **not** the
  `Eq[int]` instance.
- `(hash 5)` / `(hash "a")` emit an *undeclared* callee `hash_<gensym>` -- the
  exact same shape a genuinely-undefined `(notamethod 5)` produces.

In `src/compiler/elab_call.c`, a head symbol that is a typeclass **method name**
is looked up with `elab_lookup_sym` (line ~924); finding nothing, it falls
through to the partial-application / eval-mode call path rather than to
`elab_method_call`. Only the **dot** form `(.method obj ...)` reaches
`elab_method_call` (the `name[0]=='.'` check at line ~865), where argument-type
dispatch and monomorphization to `best_method->binding` actually happen
(`elab_typeclasses.c:2676-2982`).

So Approach A's `map-assoc-g` body -- which calls `(hash key)` and compares keys
with `Eq[K]` -- cannot compile until **both** gaps close: the class must be in
scope (Gap 1) and bare-name method calls must dispatch on their argument's
static type (Gap 2). Gap 2 is a core call-elaboration feature with blast radius
across *every* typeclass; that breadth is why GMK deferred it.

## Relationship to existing building blocks (verified)

- **`Hash` / `Eq` classes + instances** -- `stdlib/typeclass.tur` (Hash, Show,
  Num, Ord with `int`/`bool`/`cstr`/`float32` instances) and
  `stdlib/typeclass-eq.tur` (Eq class + structural instances).
- **Instance method registration** -- each `definstance` method is registered
  globally under a mangled name `__inst_<Class>_<method>_<type>`
  (`elab_typeclasses.c:1664,1981`); dispatch resolves a receiver's static type
  against `e->typeclass_env.instances` (`elab_typeclasses.c:2699-2777`) and, on
  a unique match, emits a **direct** call to `best_method->binding`
  (`elab_typeclasses.c:2969`), skipping the dictionary. Ambiguity is
  `TUR_E0020`.
- **Dictionary path** -- when the receiver is a polymorphic tyvar
  (`has_poly_params`), `make_dict_expr` builds an `EX_DICT` that emits
  `dict_<Class>_<type>_singleton.<method>(...)` (`elab_typeclasses.c:2949-2974`,
  `emit_stmt.c:355-516`, `emit_expr.c` `EX_DICT`).
- **TCE4 content-equality layer** -- `tur_hamt_*_eq`, `map-{assoc,get,has?,
  dissoc}-eq`, `cstr-hash`, `tur-cstr-key-eq?`, and the `smap-*` convenience
  layer (now the GMK lowering target for `:cstr`).
- **GMK Approach B surface** -- `smap-of` macro + `#map{...}`/`hamt-of` string
  dispatch (`elab_toplevel.c` F_MAP_LITERAL, `elab_call.c` hamt-of rewrite).
  This is what Approach A will eventually subsume.

## Phasing

### GHE0 -- make `Hash` (+ `Eq` content) available by default

Resolve Gap 1 without the redefinition collision. Preferred shape: split a
`typeclass-hash.tur` **stub** that declares `(defclass Hash [a] (hash [x] :int))`
plus the primitive instances (`int`, `bool`, `cstr`, `float32`), mirroring
`typeclass-eq.tur`, and add it to `stdlib_files[]` *before* `map.tur` (which
conceptually requires `Hash[K]`). Remove those declarations from `typeclass.tur`
or guard them so the on-demand full module stays idempotent against the stub
(the same stub/full split already used for Eq/Clone/Functor).

- **Acceptance:** with no `(load ...)`, `(.hash 5)`, `(.hash "a")`, and
  `(.hash true)` build and print stable values; equal strings hash equally; no
  `redefinition` errors; zero `expected.c` churn for programs that do not
  reference `hash` (stub bodies must be dead-strippable / not force-live like
  the Eq stub).

### GHE1 -- dispatch bare-name typeclass method calls

Resolve Gap 2. In `elab_call.c`, before the eval-mode fallback, detect that the
head symbol is a registered typeclass **method** (scan `e->typeclass_env`
classes' method names) and, when it is, route to the same argument-type
dispatch `elab_method_call` performs -- i.e. treat `(hash x)` like `(.hash x)`
(first arg is the receiver). Reuse the existing instance-resolution and
monomorphization (`best_method->binding`) so a statically-typed argument emits a
**direct** call to `__inst_Hash_hash_<T>`, and a polymorphic argument emits the
dictionary load.

Design constraints / open questions:

- **Disambiguation from user defns.** A user `(defn hash ...)` or a local
  binding named like a method must still win; only fall into method dispatch
  when `elab_lookup_sym` finds nothing (or finds the class-method placeholder).
  Confirm there is no name that is *both* a stdlib defn and a method.
- **Receiver selection for multi-param / return-dispatch methods.** Methods
  whose dispatch variable is only in the return type already have
  `elab_try_return_dispatch` (`elab_call.c:935`); keep that path. For
  argument-dispatched methods, the receiver is the argument whose type is the
  class type variable -- usually arg 0, but verify against `Num.add [x y]` etc.
- **Backwards compatibility.** Some programs may currently rely on the
  eval-mode fallback resolving a same-named *native*. Gate behind the existing
  class-membership test so only genuine method names are intercepted; this
  cannot regress a program that never declared the class.

- **Acceptance:** bare `(hash 5)`, `(hash "a")`, `(eq? 1 2)` (`:bool`),
  `(show 5)` compile and run with the correct instance; a fixture asserts
  `(= (hash "a") (hash "a"))` and `(eq? 1 1)`. `bash tests/run.sh` green.

### GHE2 -- thread `Eq[K]` to the runtime as a `bool(int64_t,int64_t)` pointer

The runtime `*-eq` ops need the comparator as a plain non-capturing function
pointer. Resolve the GMK1 `<eq-closure-for-K>` question. Two sub-options
(decide here, record the choice in this doc):

- **A1 -- method-as-value.** Make a typeclass method referenceable as a
  first-class value so the constraint-resolved `eq?` can be passed directly.
  General, larger; today referencing `eq?` as a value is `TUR-E0003`.
- **A2 -- per-`K` wrapper synthesis.** At each concrete instantiation, emit a
  tiny non-capturing `defn __eq_<K> [a :K b :K] :bool (eq? a b)` and pass its
  address -- mirrors the hand-written `tur-cstr-key-eq?`. Smaller, localized;
  the compiler emits one wrapper per `K` actually used as a key.

A2 is the lower-risk default (it is exactly what `smap-*` does by hand,
generalized). A1 is the cleaner long-term fix and is independently useful.

**DONE (A2 generalized).** Rather than synthesize a named `__eq_<K>` wrapper,
the compiler now specializes the lifted comparator *fn-value* itself per `K`, so
a plain inline `(fn [a :K b :K] (eq? a b))` works directly. The implementation
spans three sites:
- `emit_abi_scan_fn_values` (emit_module.c) -- detects a generic fn referenced
  as a value argument inside an active spec body and interns a child spec for it
  under the spec's tyvar bindings, recursing into the child clone.
- `emit_abi_register_call` -- after creating a spec, recurses into the spec body
  with those bindings active so the scan above fires.
- `emit_reresolve_fn_value` (emit_core.c, from `atom_var`) -- emits the per-`K`
  child clone name at the value-reference site.

The child clone's `(eq? a b)` re-resolves to the concrete instance via the
already-landed CGI method-call machinery. Purely additive: no existing fixture
references a generic fn-value inside a constrained-generic body, so the only
snapshot churn is gensym-ID shift from the new stdlib `-g` builders.

- **Acceptance (met):** `map-assoc-g`/`map-get-g` round-trip `:cstr` keys with
  distinct-pointer equality (fixture `ghe3-generic-map-key`).

### GHE3 -- the constrained-generic builder `map-assoc-g` (DONE)

With GHE0--GHE2 in place, `stdlib/map.tur` now carries (inline constraint form
`[^Hash K ^Eq K V]`, which is how the codebase spells constrained generics):

```turmeric
(defn map-assoc-g [^Hash K ^Eq K V] [m :int key :K val :V] :int
  (map-assoc-eq m (hash key) key val (fn [a :K b :K] :bool (eq? a b))))
```

plus `map-get-g` / `map-has-g?` / `map-dissoc-g`. The inline comparator
specializes per `K` via GHE2.

**Int-key codegen note (revised).** The plan originally required the `int`
instantiation to be byte-for-byte the identity `map-assoc` (`eq == NULL`
runtime fast path). With the uniform A2 comparator model the `int` path instead
routes through `map-assoc-eq` carrying the `Eq[int]` comparator. This is
*behaviorally* identical for int keys (hash == carrier == key, so a hash match
implies a true key match and `(= a b)` agrees with identity) but **not**
byte-for-byte the old int codegen. That only matters at GHE4, when existing
int-keyed literals are re-targeted -- see the revised gate in the status header.

- **Acceptance (met):** `map-assoc-g`/`map-get-g`/`-has-g?`/`-dissoc-g`
  round-trip for `K` in {`int`, `cstr`, `bool`, `float32`, `float`}; the `cstr`
  instantiation matches `smap-*` content-keyed behavior (distinct-pointer
  update collapses to one entry). `:float32` / `:float` were reinstated by the
  WKC carrier work (a `MapKey[K]` typeclass that bit-reinterprets the inline
  float key into the one-word carrier and supplies a carrier-ABI comparator);
  see [float32-map-key-carrier-plan.md](float32-map-key-carrier-plan.md).
  Fixtures: `ghe3-generic-map-key`, `wkc-wide-map-key`.

### GHE4 -- route `hamt-of` / `#map{...}` through `map-assoc-g`

Re-target the literal lowering and the `hamt-of` macro onto the `-g` builder,
collapsing GMK's Approach-B special-case (Approach C):

- `#map{...}` (`elab_toplevel.c` F_MAP_LITERAL): drop the string-key ->
  `smap-of` branch; lower **all** key types onto the `-g` chain. Keep the
  keyword-key `(hamt/hash-str ...)` normalization only if keyword keys are kept
  as a deliberate hash-collapsing convenience (decide + document).
- `hamt-of` macro / the `elab_call.c` hamt-of->smap-of rewrite: replace with
  the uniform `-g` chain; keep `smap-of` as a thin alias for source
  compatibility.
- **Gate:** existing `gmk-map-literal-cstr-key`, `tce3/4/5` fixtures still pass; regenerate snapshots and verify `bash tests/run.sh` zero `FAIL`.

- **Acceptance:** `#map{"a" 1}`, `#map{1 "x"}`, `#map{true 1}` all build
  correct content-keyed maps through one path; reads use the same `Eq[K]`.

### GHE5 -- generalize reads + docs + snapshot regen

`map-get` / `map-has?` / `map-dissoc` / `map-merge` / `Eq [Map]` must use the
same `Hash`/`Eq` for content keys. Provide `-g` reads wherever a literal can
build a content-keyed map. Then update docs and regenerate snapshots:

- `docs/guides/data-literals-guide.md` (relax key-type notes to "any
  `Hash`/`Eq` scalar"), the `hamt-of` / `smap-of` docstrings, this plan's
  status table, and the GMK plan's follow-up note (mark Approach C done).
- Regenerate `docs/api/` + `stdlib/docstrings.tur` and all `expected.c`
  snapshots (use the per-fixture `flags`; never the flagless loop -- see the
  GMK postmortem where a flagless regen wiped `sized-sz6-erasure`).
- **Acceptance:** `bash tests/run.sh` zero `FAIL`; `Hash`/`Eq` user instance
  for a `defopaque` key works for free.

## File touchpoints

| Phase | File | Change |
|---|---|---|
| GHE0 | `stdlib/typeclass-hash.tur` (new), `stdlib/typeclass.tur`, `src/main.c` | Split + auto-load a `Hash` stub; de-dupe instances |
| GHE1 | `src/compiler/elab_call.c` (+ `elab_typeclasses.c`) | Route bare-name method calls to argument-type dispatch |
| GHE2 | `src/compiler/` (method-as-value **or** wrapper synthesis) | Eq comparator as a `bool(i64,i64)` pointer |
| GHE3 | `stdlib/map.tur` | `map-assoc-g` + `-g` reads; int fast path |
| GHE4 | `src/compiler/elab_toplevel.c`, `elab_call.c`, `stdlib/map.tur` | Uniform `-g` lowering; retire Approach-B special-case |
| GHE5 | `stdlib/map.tur`, `docs/`, snapshots | Read surface, docs, regen |

## Risks

- **Blast radius of bare-name dispatch (GHE1).** Intercepting method names in
  the main call path touches every program. Gate strictly on class membership;
  add fixtures for "user defn shadows a method name" and "method name that is
  not a method in this program is still an unbound-symbol error".
- **Int-key snapshot churn.** The `:int` path through `map-assoc-g` + `Eq[int]` is behaviorally correct; expect snapshot diffs for int-keyed fixtures and regenerate them. Verify correctness via `bash tests/run.sh`.
- **Stub/full typeclass collision (GHE0).** Mirror the Eq/Clone idempotent
  split exactly; `(load "stdlib/typeclass.tur")` must remain valid alongside the
  auto-loaded stub.
- **Preamble bloat.** Stub bodies and `-g` builders are pulled live by macro
  references (as `hamt-of`->`map_assoc` and GMK's `smap-of`->`*-eq` already
  are). Keep stubs dead-strippable; accept only "new stdlib bodies in the
  preamble," as in TCE4/GMK.
- **Key lifetime.** Unchanged from GMK: the HAMT does not own keys; literal
  string keys are static; runtime-built keys must outlive the map.

## Non-goals

- Aggregate (multi-word struct/ADT) keys -- the carrier slot is one word.
- Changing value typing (TCE3 covers scalar values).
- A general method-as-value feature beyond what GHE2 needs (A1 may deliver it
  as a side effect, but it is not a gate).

## Open decisions to record as the work lands

1. ~~GHE2: **A1 (method-as-value)** vs **A2 (wrapper synthesis)** -- default A2.~~
   **Decided: A2, generalized to per-`K` fn-value specialization** (a plain
   inline `(fn ...)` comparator specializes; no named-wrapper synthesis needed).
2. ~~GHE4: keep keyword keys as hash-collapsed, or content-key them too.~~
   **Resolved by TMS: kept hash-collapsed** -- maps have no first-class keyword
   key type; `:name` lowers to `(hamt/hash-str "name")`, an int key.
3. ~~Whether `smap-*` / `smap-of` remain as public aliases or are deprecated.~~
   **Resolved by TMS: removed entirely.** The unified `map-*` macros are the
   single path; the literal lowering's string-key special-case was deleted.
4. ~~GHE4: hold the int path byte-for-byte, or relax the zero-diff gate.~~
   **Resolved by TMS: relaxed.** Int keys ride the same uniform carrier as every
   other key; snapshots were regenerated.
5. `:float32` (and other content keys wider/narrower than the one-word carrier):
   deferred to [float32-map-key-carrier-plan.md](float32-map-key-carrier-plan.md).
6. **GHE5 `Eq [Map]` -- `:cstr` and struct keys now content-correct** (fixtures
   `eqmap-cstr-content`, `eqmap-struct-content`). `(.eq? a b)` on a concrete
   `Map[K V]` threads the per-`K` `MapKey` comparator at the dispatch site
   (`try_synth_recursive_eq` + `map-eq-k?`): `(mk-cmp (:: 0 cstr))` for `:cstr`,
   `(mk-cmp (make-struct K 0 ...))` for all-`:int`-field structs. The
   `defopaque`-ascription deref segfault was also fixed (`opaque-ascribe-int`).
   **Remaining:** non-`:int`-field struct keys, and the generic-dict `Eq [Map]`
   path (still identity; needs the true general HKT-instance element-dispatch
   fix). Content *lookup* (`map-get`/`map-has?`) was always correct.
