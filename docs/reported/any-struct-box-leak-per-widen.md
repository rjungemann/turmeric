# Widening a by-value struct/record-ADT to any mallocs a box that is never freed

**Severity: medium** on hot paths, low otherwise -- one leak per widen,
documented as accepted in the union/intersection guide. Found in the
2026-08-20 docs audit.

## Repro

A loop passing a by-value struct to a `[x : any]` parameter grows RSS
linearly.

## Root cause

src/compiler/emit_expr.c:3834-3836 --
`({ T *__tur_box = malloc(...); *__tur_box = ...; TUR_TAG(...); })` with no
ownership fold or drop glue for the box.

## Fix direction

Give the `any` box drop glue (or arena/ownership-fold treatment mirroring
`type_is_boxed_container_elem` elements), or intern constant widenings at file
scope like the fat-shim boxes.
