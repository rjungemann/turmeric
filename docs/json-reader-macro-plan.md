# `#json{...}` Reader Macro -- Plan (JR0--JR5)

## Motivation

Pasting JSON into Turmeric today requires either a runtime `json-parse` call on
a string literal (no compile-time validation, verbose) or hand-translating the
JSON into nested map/vec constructor calls (tedious, error-prone). A
`#json{...}` reader macro solves both problems: the JSON is validated at compile
time, the result is a first-class Turmeric value (a HAMT map, a vec, or a
primitive), and the source is copy-pasteable from any JSON source.

Primary use cases:

- Embedding fixture data and test payloads directly in source.
- Defining default configs that happen to be JSON-shaped.
- Calling APIs that accept `ptr<void>` map arguments without constructing the
  map manually.

---

## Design

### Delimiter choice

`#json{...}` uses `{` / `}` as the outer fence. Because JSON objects also use
`{}`, a bare object becomes `#json{{...}}` -- the outer pair is the macro fence,
the inner pair is the JSON object. This is unambiguous but visually noisy.

Two alternative outer delimiters avoid the double-brace:

| Syntax | Top-level object | Top-level array |
|---|---|---|
| `#json{...}` | `#json{{"a": 1}}` | `#json{[1, 2]}` |
| `#json[...]` | `#json[{"a": 1}]` | `#json[[1, 2]]` |
| `#json(...)` | `#json({"a": 1})` | `#json([1, 2])` |

**Recommendation: `#json(...)`.** Round parens never appear as structural
characters in JSON, so `#json({"a": 1})` reads cleanly and `#json([1, 2])` has
no doubled delimiter. The reader already dispatches on `#` + next-char, so
adding `#json(` is a single new dispatch branch.

### What the reader produces

The reader parses the JSON at compile time and emits a Turmeric S-expression
equivalent:

| JSON | Turmeric equivalent |
|---|---|
| `{"a": 1, "b": true}` | `(hamt-of "a" 1 "b" true)` |
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `(vec-of 1 2 3)` |
| `"hello"` | `"hello"` (`:cstr` literal) |
| `42` | `42` (`:int` literal) |
| `3.14` | `3.14` (`:float` literal) |
| `true` / `false` | `1` / `0` (`:bool` literal) |
| `null` | `(nil-value)` |

The emitted S-expression is elaborated by the normal typechecker, so types are
checked and values participate in type inference as usual.

### Brace / string tracking in the reader

The reader sub-parser for `#json(...)` must handle:

1. **Paren depth**: track `(` / `)` depth; exit at depth 0.
2. **String mode**: on `"`, consume until the matching unescaped `"`,
   treating `\"` as an escape. Depth counting is suppressed inside strings.
3. No other context is needed -- `[`, `]`, `{`, `}` inside JSON are passed
   through as-is since the JSON sub-parser handles them.

This is ~60 lines of C added to `src/compiler/reader.c`.

## Phases

### JR0 -- Reader sub-parser

Implement the JSON-to-S-expression reader in `src/compiler/reader.c`:

- Dispatch `#json(` in the `#`-dispatch table.
- Recursive descent: `json_read_value`, `json_read_object`, `json_read_array`,
  `json_read_string`, `json_read_number`.
- Emit `hamt-of`, `vec-of`, string/int/float/bool literals, `nil-value`.
- Parse errors (malformed JSON, unexpected EOF) become `TUR-E0270` reader
  errors with line/col pointing into the `#json(` block.

### JR1 -- `hamt-of` and `vec-of` builtins (or macro expansion)

`hamt-of` and `vec-of` need to exist as stdlib macros or compiler builtins that
construct a HAMT map / growable vec from a flat key-value / element list.

Check whether `stdlib/hamt.tur` already exposes a multi-pair constructor; if
not, add:

```turmeric
;;; hamt-of -- construct a HAMT map from alternating key/value pairs.
(defmacro hamt-of [& pairs] ...)

;;; vec-of -- construct a Vec from a sequence of elements.
(defmacro vec-of [& elems] ...)
```

### JR2 -- Type annotation on the macro

Allow an optional type hint on the outer form for future use with typed
decoding (see Future Work below):

```turmeric
#json<MyStruct>({"name": "alice", "age": 42})
```

In this phase the hint is parsed and stored but ignored during elaboration
(the result is still a `ptr<void>` HAMT). This reserves the syntax.

### JR3 -- Fixture: `tests/fixtures/json-reader-*`

Add test fixtures:

- `json-reader-object` -- `#json({"a": 1, "b": "hello"})` round-trips correctly
- `json-reader-array` -- `#json([1, 2, 3])` produces a vec
- `json-reader-nested` -- nested objects and arrays
- `json-reader-null` -- `null` → `nil-value`
- `json-reader-escape` -- `"he said \"hi\""` string escapes

### JR4 -- Docstring and guide

- `;;;` docstring on the `#json(...)` form description in `stdlib/json.tur`
  (or a new file `stdlib/json-reader.tur`).
- `docs/guides/json-guide.md` covering the reader macro, runtime `json-parse`,
  and the interplay with `tur/hamt`.

### JR5 -- `just docs` + snapshot audit

Regenerate all codegen snapshots affected by `hamt-of` / `vec-of` macro
expansion, run `bash tests/run.sh`, confirm zero `FAIL` lines.

## Error codes

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `TUR-E0270` | Malformed JSON inside a `#json(...)` block |
| `TUR-E0271` | Unexpected EOF inside a `#json(...)` block |

---

## Non-goals for JR0--JR5

- **Runtime JSON parsing** -- a `json-parse` stdlib function that parses a
  `cstr` at runtime is a separate feature. This plan is compile-time only.
- **Serialization** -- writing Turmeric values back to JSON strings is out of
  scope.
- **WASM/streaming** -- JSON is validated once at compile time; no streaming
  parser is needed.

---

## Future work: typed JSON decoding (option #3)

The `#json<Type>(...)` syntax reserved in JR2 is the entry point for a more
ambitious extension: instead of producing a `ptr<void>` HAMT, the reader
macro validates the JSON structure against a named `defstruct` (or a
schema from a `tur/schema` library) and emits a typed struct constructor call.

For example:

```turmeric
(defstruct Point [x :float y :float])

(def p #json<Point>({"x": 1.5, "y": 2.0}))
;; elaborates to: (Point 1.5 2.0)
;; type: Point
;; compile-time error if field is missing or wrong type
```

The open questions for this extension:

1. **Field-name mapping** -- JSON keys are strings; struct fields are symbols.
   Needs a convention (exact match, snake_case ↔ camelCase, or explicit
   `#[json-name "camelField"]` annotation).
2. **Optional and nullable fields** -- `null` must map to an `Option` type or
   a sentinel value; the struct definition needs to declare which fields are
   optional.
3. **Arrays to typed vecs** -- `[1, 2, 3]` inside a typed context should
   produce `Vec<int>` rather than `Vec<any>`.
4. **Interplay with `tur/schema`** -- if a schema library is added (see
   [IDEAS.md](../upcoming/IDEAS.md)), typed decoding could delegate validation
   to the schema instead of reading field types directly from `defstruct`.
   The `#json<MySchema>(...)` form would then call `schema-decode` at compile
   time.

This is non-trivial but achievable. It requires the elaborator to walk the JSON
S-expression tree against the struct's field type list, which is a small
bidirectional type-checking pass. Estimate: ~500 lines in `elab_call.c` or a
new `elab_json.c`, after JR0--JR5 are complete.
