title: Nested Closures Fail to Transitively Capture Grandparent Variables
category: Reported Bug
description: A closure nested two levels deep that references a variable bound in its grandparent scope emits C that references an undeclared local (the variable is never threaded into the middle closure's environment). The generated C fails to compile. Affects plain `defn` as well as instance methods; orthogonal to the dict-field carrier type.

# Nested Closures Fail to Transitively Capture Grandparent Variables -- Reported Bug

> **Status:** FIXED (found 2026-06-03, fixed 2026-06-04)
> **Severity:** High -- a hard C **compile error** (`'n_854' undeclared`), not a
>   warning. Any genuinely curried closure whose innermost body reads an
>   outermost binding fails to build. Latent because most curried closures in
>   the tree only reference their immediate parent's parameter.
> **Found:** while executing
>   [closure-returning-instance-method-codegen-plan](../upcoming/closure-returning-instance-method-codegen-plan.md);
>   surfaced by the T6.4 "nested" coverage fixture.
> **Scope:** general closure codegen -- reproduces in a plain `defn`, with no
>   typeclasses or `definstance` involved. It is **not** the dict-field carrier
>   bug fixed by that plan (that fix landed; the curried *return type* now
>   lowers to `int64_t` at all three sites). This is a separate capture-set
>   threading defect.

## Summary

A three-level curried closure where the **innermost** closure references a
variable bound by the **outermost** function (skipping the middle closure) does
not thread that variable through the middle closure's environment. The middle
closure's generated constructor references the variable by its mangled local
name, but that name is not in scope there -- it lives in the outer function's
frame, which the middle closure never captured.

## Minimal repro

```turmeric
(defn adder [n :int] : (fn [:int] (fn [:int] :int))
  (fn [x :int] : (fn [:int] :int)
    (fn [y :int] :int (+ (+ x y) n))))   ;; inner reads x (parent) AND n (grandparent)
(defn main [] :int 0)
```

```sh
$ ./build/tur emit-c repro.tur > repro.c && cc -std=c99 -c repro.c
repro.c:3193:20: error: 'n_854' undeclared (first use in this function)
```

### Observed vs. expected

- **Observed:** the middle closure's constructor (`__fn_<mid>`) emits
  `__env->n = n_854;` (threading `n` into the *inner* closure's env) but
  `n_854` is not a parameter or local of `__fn_<mid>` -- it is the outer
  `adder`'s parameter. The middle closure captured `x` but never captured `n`,
  so `n` is unavailable to forward. C fails to compile.
- **Expected:** `n` is part of the middle closure's capture set (because a
  closure it builds needs it), so the middle env carries `n` and forwards it to
  the inner env. The program builds and `((adder 100) 20) 3 == 123`.

## Root-cause direction

The free-variable / capture-set analysis computes a closure's captures from the
variables its *own* body mentions, but does not take the transitive closure
over variables needed by *nested* closures it constructs. A variable read only
by a grandchild closure must still be captured by every intermediate closure on
the path from its binder, so each frame can forward it inward.

### Root cause (confirmed)

Closures are elaborated inner-first. By the time `collect_free_vars`
(`src/compiler/elab_core.c`) runs on the *middle* closure's body, the *inner*
closure has already been elaborated into an `EX_CLOSURE` node -- its body no
longer exposes `x`/`n` as bare `EX_VAR`s (they are accessed through the inner
env at emit time). `collect_free_vars` had **no `EX_CLOSURE` case** in its
traversal switch, so the inner closure's free variables were invisible to the
middle closure's analysis. The middle closure ended up capturing only `x`
(which is its own parameter, so it was already in scope at emit time and
"worked by luck") and never `n`. At emit time the middle closure's
env-forwarding (`emit_expr.c:2397`, `name_for_binding` in `emit_core.c:734`)
emitted `__env->n = n_854;`, referencing a name that lives in the outer
`adder` frame and is undeclared in the middle thunk.

Descending into the inner `EX_CLOSURE`'s `fn->body` is *not* the right fix: that
would also collect the inner closure's own params (`y`, plus its env param) as
free variables of the middle closure. Instead the fix folds in the inner
closure's *already-computed capture set* (`closure->captures`), which by
construction excludes the inner's own params/locals, subject to the same
param/global/local filtering used for `EX_VAR`.

## Fix

`src/compiler/elab_core.c` -- added an `EX_CLOSURE` case to the
`collect_free_vars` traversal that unions the nested closure's capture set
(minus the enclosing scope's params and locals) into the enclosing closure's
free-variable set. No emit-side change was needed: once `n` is in the middle
closure's capture set, `name_for_binding` resolves it to `__env->n` and the
env struct/forwarding code carries it through automatically.

## Validation

- The repro above compiles cleanly and prints `123` from
  `((adder 100) 20) 3` (applied through the fat protocol -- see the fixture).
- Regression fixture: `tests/fixtures/closure-transitive-grandparent-capture`
  exercises transitive capture through two closure levels and passes
  end-to-end (`expected.stdout` = `123`).
- Full suite green: `bash tests/run.sh` -> 1354 passed, 0 failed.

## Workaround in the meantime

Curried closures whose inner bodies reference only their immediate parent's
parameters work today. The
`tests/fixtures/instance-closure-return-nested` coverage fixture is
deliberately written this way (the inner closure reads only `x`, never a
grandparent binding) so it exercises the curried *return-type* carrier fix
without tripping this orthogonal capture bug.
