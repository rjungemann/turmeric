title: Applying the Result of a Higher-Order-Returning Parameter Is "Not Callable"
category: Reported Bug
description: A parameter whose declared type is a function that *returns a function* -- e.g. `f : (fn [int] (fn [int] int))` or the `->` spelling `f : (-> int (-> int int))` -- loses the inner function type at the application site. The first application `(f 1)` type-checks, but the *second* application `((f 1) 2)` fails with `TUR-E0002: function '__call_head_*' returns ?, which is not callable`. The result-of-application type is erased to "?" rather than recovered as the inner `(fn [int] int)`. Surfaced while implementing fn-type-bare-identifier-plan (the curried fixture case).

# Applying the Result of a Higher-Order-Returning Parameter Is "Not Callable" -- Reported Bug

> **Status:** FIXED 2026-06-04 (type-checking + closure-value codegen). One
>   narrow runtime limitation remains documented below.
> **Found:** while implementing the curried fixture case of
>   [fn-type-bare-identifier-plan](../upcoming/fn-type-bare-identifier-plan.md).
> **Severity:** Medium -- a hard, non-silent error (`TUR-E0002`), so it
>   does not miscompile. But it blocks an entire class of curried
>   higher-order signatures from being *used* (the signature type-checks,
>   only the second application is rejected), forcing the `:ptr<void>` +
>   annotated-`^fat` recovery workaround that the typed-signal plans
>   already lean on.

## Resolution (2026-06-04)

Four changes, spanning the type-expression elaborator, the closure-value
producer, the call-head consumer, and the let-binding propagator:

1. **Type-expression elaborator** (`src/compiler/elab_types.c`). The
   `(fn ...)` type-expression handler now stores `result_full_type` (and
   `arg_full_types`) when the result/arg is itself a compound type --
   crucially including `TY_FN`. The `->` handler's `aggregate_result`
   predicate likewise now includes `TY_FN`. This is what makes `(f 1)`
   recover the inner `(fn [int] int)` instead of erasing it to `?`, fixing
   the reported `TUR-E0002` for all three spellings.

2. **Closure-value producer** (`src/compiler/elab_fns.c`). The first-class
   `EX_CLOSURE` value type (`clo_ty`) is rebuilt without the env param; it
   now copies `result_full_type` so a *closure that returns a function*
   keeps the inner `(fn ...)` type on its value. Without this, a let-bound
   local closure applied as `((f 1) 2)` recovered a bare result kind.

3. **Let-binding propagator** (`src/compiler/elab_forms.c`). The root-cause
   miscompile: a `let` binding aliasing a *function that returns a closure*
   (an `EX_VAR` naming a plain `TY_FN` defn/lambda with
   `returns_closure_fn_binding` set but no `closure_fn_binding` of its own)
   was wrongly marked as a *closure value* (`closure_fn_binding`). That made
   `elab_call_fn` swap in the inner thunk's type and subtract a hidden env
   param from the arity, so `(f 1)` resolved to the inner *result* kind
   (`int`) and `(g ...)` was "not a function". It now propagates
   `returns_closure_fn_binding` instead, leaving the alias callable at its
   true arity.

4. **Call-head consumer** (`src/compiler/elab_call.c`). When the head of a
   chained application is the *result of a call* whose static type is a
   function (`((adder 1) 2)`), the synthesized `__call_head_*` binding now
   adopts the callee's `returns_closure_fn_binding` so the second
   application dispatches through the closure thunk rather than treating the
   fat-closure box address as a thin function pointer (which jumped to
   garbage and segfaulted). A call that returns a *bare fn reference* (e.g.
   `((pick) 5)` where `pick` returns `inc`) resolves to `NULL` here and
   correctly stays a thin function-pointer call.

Regression coverage:
`tests/fixtures/curried-fn-typed-param-application/` (runnable: top-level
closure-returning defn, let-bound intermediate, local capturing lambda,
arrow-spelled curried parameter, and the thin captureless returner), plus
`tests/fixtures/fn-type-bare-identifier/` upgraded from signature-only to a
real `((f 1) 2)` application.

### Remaining limitation (not fixed)

Passing a function that returns a **fat (capturing) closure** *through a
fn-typed parameter* and then applying the result -- e.g.
`(apply-curried adder 1 2)` where the parameter is
`(fn [int] (fn [int] int))` and `adder` captures -- still segfaults at
runtime. This is irreducible at the `((f a) b)` site: a fn-typed parameter
carries a *thin* function pointer, and the compiler cannot tell whether the
opaque `f` returns a thin pointer (works, e.g. a `(fn [a] inc)`) or a fat
closure box (needs thunk dispatch). It is the same pre-existing thin-param /
fat-closure gap that already makes single-application
`(apply1 (capturing-closure) x)` segfault. Resolving it requires a uniform
closure ABI through fn-typed parameters (box every function-typed value, or
runtime-tag thin vs fat) and is tracked as future work, not by this report.

## Summary

When a `defn` parameter is declared with a function type whose **result is
itself a function type**, the compiler accepts the signature and accepts the
*first* application, but rejects the *second* application: the type of
`(f x)` is erased to `?` instead of being recovered as the declared inner
function type.

This is **independent of the leading-colon syntax** -- it reproduces
identically with the bare-identifier form, the legacy `:`-keyword form, and
the `->` spelling.

## Repro

```turmeric
;; bare-identifier (fn ...) form
(defn curried [f : (fn [int] (fn [int] int))] : int
  ((f 1) 2))
(defn main [] : int 0)
```

```turmeric
;; legacy keyword (fn ...) form -- same failure
(defn curried [f : (fn [:int] (fn [:int] :int))] : int
  ((f 1) 2))
```

```turmeric
;; arrow form -- same failure
(defn curried [f : (-> int (-> int int))] : int
  ((f 1) 2))
```

All three produce:

```
error [TUR-E0002]: function '__call_head_*' returns ?, which is not
callable -- did you mean to pass all 0 argument(s)?
  ((f 1) 2)
  ^^^^^^^^^
```

### Observed vs. expected

- **Observed:** `(f 1)` is treated as returning `?` (unknown), so the outer
  application `((f 1) 2)` is rejected as "not callable".
- **Expected:** `(f 1)` has type `(fn [int] int)` (the declared result of
  `f`), so `((f 1) 2)` is a well-typed `int`.

The *signature alone* type-checks fine -- `(defn higher [f : (fn [int] (fn
[int] int))] : int 0)` passes `tur check`. Only the nested application is
rejected.

## Root cause (suspected)

The result type of an application is recovered from the callee's stored
function type. For a parameter typed `(fn [A] (fn [B] C))`, the *outer* fn's
result slot is a `TY_FN`, but the application-elaboration path appears to
collapse the result to its `TypeKind` (a pointer/closure carrier) and drop
the full `Type *` for the inner `(fn ...)`. The second application then has
no inner function type to dispatch on, so the callee type is "?".

Two relevant sites in `src/compiler/elab_types.c`:

- The `(fn ...)` type-expression handler (~`elab_types.c:901-957`) builds the
  type with `type_fn(fn_arg_kinds, n_fn_args, ret_kind)` and sets only
  `effect_row`. Unlike the `->` handler (~`elab_types.c:1063-1086`), it does
  **not** populate `arg_full_types` / `result_full_type` when an arg or the
  result is itself a compound (e.g. `TY_FN`) type. *However*, fixing only
  this does not resolve the bug: the `->` form -- which *does* store full
  types -- fails identically, so the erasure is (also) on the application /
  call-result-recovery side, not solely in the `fn` type-expression builder.

The call-result recovery lives in the call-elaboration path
(`src/compiler/elab_call.c`, the `__call_head_*` synthesis); it should read
the callee fn type's `result_full_type` (when present) and use it as the type
of the application node, so a chained application sees a `TY_FN` rather than a
bare result kind.

## Proposed fix directions

1. In the `(fn ...)` type-expression handler, mirror the `->` handler: when
   any param or the result is a compound type (`TY_FN`, `TY_APP`, `TY_FORALL`,
   ...), store `arg_full_types` / `result_full_type` on the synthesized
   `TY_FN` so the inner function type survives.
2. In the call-result-recovery path, when the callee's fn type carries a
   `result_full_type`, propagate it as the type of the application expression
   (instead of reconstructing a bare type from the result `TypeKind`). This is
   what lets the *second* application find a callable `TY_FN`.
3. Add a runnable regression fixture exercising
   `((f 1) 2)` through a curried parameter once both sides thread the inner
   type.

## Validation when fixed

1. All three repros above compile, and a runnable program where `f` is
   `(fn [a] (fn [b] (+ a b)))` applied as `((f 1) 2)` prints `3`.
2. `bash tests/run.sh` stays green (zero new FAILs).
3. The curried case in `tests/fixtures/fn-type-bare-identifier/` can be
   upgraded from signature-only to a real nested application.

  [fn-typed-return-lowered-to-result-type](fn-typed-return-lowered-to-result-type.md)
  (producer-side return lowering, resolved). That fix threaded the inner type
  through the *producer* signature; this bug is the *application/consumer*
  side of the same "inner fn type erased" family.
