title: Variadic HKT rows (kind-level type lists) are missing from the elaborator
category: Expressiveness hole
status: IMPLEMENTED -- all six layers landed (see "Status: all six layers landed" below). A constructor can be parameterised by a `#row{...}` row of types via the `^&` row-kinded parameter; rows are kind-checked at every application, support a membership/concat/union/intersect algebra, and erase fully at codegen.
severity: Forces an arity-N macro-family workaround for any "typed heterogeneous row" feature (ECS queries, relational rows, data-frame schemas). Not blocking for v1 work that accepts the cap.
description: The HKT machinery supports fixed-arity type constructors but has no kind-level list-of-types, so a `Query in out` parameterised by a row of components, a relation parameterised by a tuple of columns, or any other variadic-row abstraction has to be macro-generated as `Query1`..`QueryN` -- the same retreat Bevy/Specs/aztecs took. The downstream plans (ECS v1) have absorbed this by capping at arity 5 with a documented migration path.

# Variadic HKT rows are missing

## Summary

Turmeric's HKT support (per `docs/guides/hkt-guide.md`) lets a type
constructor be abstracted over and partially applied at the type level,
but **the kind system has no `List Type` (or `Row :: List Type`)**. Every
HKT-using abstraction today is parameterised by a fixed-arity tuple of
type arguments. There is no way to write `Query (cons Pos (cons Vel
nil)) (cons Pos nil)` and have the elaborator see the row structurally.

Workarounds in practice are macro-generated families
(`Query1`/`Query2`/.../`QueryN`), capped at some arity N. This is the
pattern Specs / Bevy / aztecs all settled on in Haskell/Rust; the whole
pitch of the ECS plan (and of `stats-formula-plan`, and any future
relational layer) is that we would not have to.

## Where this bites

- `docs/upcoming/v1/ecs-spice-plan.md` ships `queryN` (arity 1..5) on
  the v1 track and reserves the variadic `query` form for v2 E1, gated
  on this work. The arity cap is the same retreat Bevy/Specs took; we
  accept it for v1 with a documented migration path, but the original
  pitch ("more invariants at the type level than Haskell") is weaker
  until it lifts.
- `stats-formula-plan` and any future data-frame work want the same
  primitive (rows of columns) and would have to re-implement the same
  macro family, then re-migrate when this lands.
- A general relational / Datalog-results layer over heterogeneous tuples
  is currently expressible only via untyped cons-lists with downcasts at
  the use site, or via the same arity-N macro pattern.

## Observed vs. expected

**Observed.** No `Row` / `List Type` kind. No way to write a type
parameter that ranges over "a tuple of N types for any N." The HKT plan
in the archive treats associated types and type-level lists as
"deferred / not started."

**Expected (for the plans that depend on this).** A kind-level
`List Type` (or a dedicated `Row` kind), a `Row` HKT, and the elaborator
machinery to:

- check membership (`Pos in row`) against a row term,
- form unions/intersections of rows for query joins,
- propagate row arguments through partial application of a higher-kinded
  constructor.

## Root cause

The elaborator's kind language is fixed: `Type`, `Type -> Type`,
`Type -> Type -> Type`, etc. Adding a `List Type` kind is a real
elaborator project (new kind constructor, unification rules for cons /
nil at kind level, normalisation, fixture work). It is not a small
patch.

## Proposed directions

1. **Fund the elaborator work.** Add a `Row` (or `List Type`) kind,
   row-level cons/nil, structural row equality, and `in`/`++`
   primitives. Validate against `tests/fixtures/hkt-row-*` and an ECS
   query fixture.
2. **Document the macro-arity fallback as the v1 reality.** If we are
   not funding (1) in this release window, update `hkt-guide.md`,
   `ecs-spice-plan.md`, and `stats-formula-plan` to say so explicitly,
   so downstream plans stop quoting variadic rows as available.
3. **Hybrid: ship `Row` as runtime-only first.** A list-of-`TypeRep`
   row would unblock query macros at the cost of giving up the
   compile-time membership check. This is what Haskell ECSes do; we
   would be no worse off than they are.

## Validation of a fix

- A query / row fixture that declares `Query [Pos Vel] [Pos]` and
  `Query [Pos] [Pos]` and gets a compile error from
  `Query [Pos Vel] [Foo]` when `Foo` is unregistered.
- Row-polymorphic identity: `(defn id-row [r] (fn [x : Row r] x))`
  type-checks and is callable at distinct row instantiations.
- Stats / data-frame fixture: `Frame [Name :str Age :int]` zip with
  `Frame [Age :int Name :str]` is a row-permutation no-op, not a type
  error.

## Progress (Direction 1 -- funding the elaborator work)

Direction 1 is the chosen path. It is a multi-layer elaborator project; the
layers are being landed incrementally, each validated on its own before the
next builds on it, so no half-finished layer can silently miscompile.

### Layer 1 -- kind-level `List Type` in the kind language [LANDED]

The kind language was fixed at `KIND_STAR` and the `KIND_ARROW{N}` ladder
(plus the `KIND_ROW` *effect*-row sentinel, an unrelated concept). The first
layer adds a distinct kind-level list-of-types sentinel so the rest of the
machinery has a kind to attach a row to:

- `KIND_TYPEROW ((Kind)0xFFFE)` in `src/compiler/types.h` -- the kind of a
  *row of types* (`[Pos Vel]`). Disjoint from `KIND_ROW` (0xFFFF, effect rows)
  and from every arrow arity.
- `kind_to_string` / `kind_parse` round-trip it as `"[*]"`
  (`src/compiler/types.c`).
- `kind_apply_one` treats it as inert (identity), like `KIND_ROW`: a row is a
  first-class kind, not a constructor you apply.
- `kind_is_arrow_ladder` (`src/passes/kind_check.c`) excludes it, so
  `kind_unify` rejects `[*]` vs `*` / `* -> *` / `Row` with `TUR-E0012`, and
  `kind_of_type_app` rejects applying a row as a constructor.
- Unit target `tur_kind_row_unit` (`tests/compiler/test_kind_row.c`, registered
  in `src/CMakeLists.txt` + root `CMakeLists.txt`) pins the parse/print
  round-trip, sentinel disjointness, the apply/unify algebra, and the
  diagnostic counts for the mismatch cases.

### Prerequisites surfaced by a code-level pass (do these first)

A detailed read of the type/parser/codegen subsystems turned up three
prerequisites that were *not* in the original layer list and that change the
sequencing. Tackle them before the type-variant work.

- **PRE-1 [RESOLVED -> `#row{...}` reader form]: the bare-`[...]` row syntax in
  the report's original examples is already taken.** Since KB-029, a bracketed
  type list `[T1 T2 ... Tn]` in *type-annotation position* lowers to the stdlib
  `TupleN` struct (arity 2..8) -- see `elab_types.c:1519-1553` (`F_VEC` branch
  of `type_expr_from_form`). So `Query [Pos Vel] [Pos]` as written would
  silently become `Query (Tuple2 Pos Vel) (Tuple1 Pos)`, i.e. two `KIND_STAR`
  tuples, not rows. Bare brackets are therefore unusable for rows.

  **Decision: spell rows with a `#row{...}` reader-dispatch form**, alongside
  the existing `#map{...}` / `#set{...}` data literals (`reader.c:1035`,
  `try_read_data_literal`). Rationale:
    - It is a *distinct* form, so it never perturbs the `[...]`->`TupleN`
      tuple-sugar path and needs no context-driven disambiguation (PRE-2 is
      consequently **dropped** -- `type_expr_from_form` stays context-free).
    - It reuses an existing, tested reader-dispatch mechanism (~10 lines added
      to the `try_read_data_literal` table for `#row{`).
    - It scales to *labeled* rows for the data-frame case for free, by mirroring
      `#map{...}`'s keyword-key/value reader: `#row{Pos Vel}` is positional
      (ECS), `#row{:name :str :age :int}` is labeled (frames).
    - Spiritually identical to Rust `frunk`'s `hlist![A, B]` macro and Haskell
      DataKinds' promoted list `'[A, B]`, in Turmeric's house style.

  Surface examples (revised; supersede the bracket forms in the validation
  section):

  ```turmeric
  (defn run [q : (Query #row{Pos Vel} #row{Pos})] : int ...)  ; positional, ECS
  (def schema : #row{:name :str :age :int})                    ; labeled, frame
  ```

  **Rejected alternatives:**
    - *Haskell-style tick* `'[Pos Vel]` -- `'` is already the reader macro for
      `(quote x)` *and* for lifetime symbols `'a` (`reader.c:162,511`), so a
      leading tick on a bracket reads as `(quote [...])`. Unavailable.
    - *Context-driven bare `[...]`* (old option 2) -- would require threading an
      expected kind through `type_expr_from_form` (PRE-2) and risks perturbing
      the tuple-sugar path. Heavier and riskier than a distinct reader form.
    - *Unify tuple and row* (old option 3) -- treat `TupleN` as the `KIND_STAR`
      view of a row. Elegant but couples two features; deferred, not blocking.

- **PRE-2 [DROPPED by the PRE-1 resolution]: thread an expected kind into type
  elaboration.** This was only needed for the context-driven bare-`[...]`
  option. With the `#row{...}` reader form, `type_expr_from_form`
  (`elab_types.c:271`) stays context-free -- a `#row{...}` literal carries its
  own dispatch tag, so no expected-kind threading is required. Recorded here
  for history; not on the critical path.

- **PRE-3 (safety, blocking Layer 2): audit the `TypeKind` switches before
  adding a variant.** A new `TY_TYPEROW` is a miscompile trap until every
  switch handles it. The dangerous ones found:
    - `type_eq` (`types.c:51`) ends in **`default: return 1`** -- two distinct
      `TY_TYPEROW`s would compare **equal** (silent miscompile). MUST add an
      explicit structural case (mirror the `TY_UNION`/`TY_INTERSECTION` member
      loop at `types.c:179-201`).
    - `type_name_buf` (`types.c:1503`) has **no default** -- a missing case
      prints nothing.
    - `type_c_name` (`types.c:1893`) falls back to `"void"`; add an explicit
      erase case (rows are compile-time only, like `TY_TYPECLASS`/`TY_GLOBAL`
      which already erase to `void`/`void*`).
    - `type_effective_kind` (`kind_check.c:127`) defaults to `KIND_STAR`; add a
      case returning `KIND_TYPEROW`.
    - the `copy_kind` switch (`types.h:~300-400`) -- rows are compile-time, so
      `CK_COPY`.
  The `Type` union should mirror the `TY_UNION` representation exactly:
  `struct { struct Type **elements; uint8_t n_elements; } typerow_;`
  with an arena-allocated `Type*` array (`type_union_build` at `types.c:2712`
  is the constructor to copy).

### Layer 2 -- `TY_TYPEROW` type variant [LANDED]

The compile-time row-of-types value, built and validated entirely at the C
level (no parser/codegen dependency yet). PRE-3 was executed alongside it.

- `TY_TYPEROW` added to the `TypeKind` enum (`types.h`); union member
  `typerow_ { Type **elements; uint8_t n_elements; }`, mirroring `union_` /
  `intersection_`. `type_typerow(arena, elements, n)` constructor copies the
  element-pointer array onto the arena, sets `hkt_kind = KIND_TYPEROW` and
  `copy_kind = CK_COPY`. Element order is significant, duplicates are
  preserved, and nested rows are *not* flattened (a row is a list, not a set).
- **Equality.** `type_eq` gains an explicit order-SENSITIVE structural case
  (the PRE-3 landmine: without it, two rows fell through `default: return 1`
  and compared equal). `type_typerow_eq_perm` is a separate order-INSENSITIVE
  (multiset) comparator backing the data-frame column-permutation case.
- **PRE-3 switch audit, enforced by `-Werror=switch`.** Handled in `type_eq`,
  `type_name`, `type_name_buf` (prints `#row{...}`), `type_c_name` (erases to
  `/*type-row*/ void`), `typekind_default_copy_kind` (`CK_COPY`),
  `type_is_guarded_recursive_helper` (guards like a union), and
  `type_effective_kind` in `kind_check.c` (`KIND_TYPEROW`). A full
  `-Werror=switch` build is now the regression guard for any *future*
  `TypeKind`-exhaustive switch that forgets rows.
- Unit target `tur_typerow_unit` (`tests/compiler/test_typerow.c`, registered
  in both CMake files): 25 assertions covering construction, order-sensitive
  vs permutation equality, duplicate/nesting semantics, the empty row, and the
  printed `#row{...}` form. LSan-clean (uses `type_print` into an owned `Buf`,
  not the leaky composite-name path of `type_name`).

Purely additive: full fixture suite still green (no fixture constructs a row
yet -- surface syntax is Layer 3).

### Layer 3 -- `#row{...}` surface syntax [LANDED]

The reader form and its lowering to `TY_TYPEROW` in type position.

- **Reader.** New `F_ROW_LITERAL` Form tag (payload identical to `F_LIST`,
  mirroring `F_SET_LITERAL`); `read_row_literal` + a `#row{` branch in
  `try_read_data_literal` (`reader.c`), gated behind `-Xdata-literals` like the
  other data literals. The unknown-dispatch error now lists `#row{...}` too.
- **Elaboration.** `type_expr_from_form` (`elab_types.c`) lowers an
  `F_ROW_LITERAL` in *type* position to a `TY_TYPEROW` (elements are the
  positional element type forms; empty `#row{}` is the unit row). In *value*
  position `elab_form` (`elab_toplevel.c`) emits a clean type-only error --
  a row is a type, not a value.
- **`-Werror=switch` blast radius.** A new Form tag forced handling in every
  `FormTag`-exhaustive switch: the form printer (`forms.c`), the formatter
  (`fmt.c`, two switches -- `#row{...}` round-trips through `tur fmt`), the
  macro/quasiquote/ct-eval/substitute paths (`elab_macros.c`, 5 sites) and the
  turi interpreter's equivalents (`interp.c`, 3 sites) -- all treat a row
  literal structurally like a set literal (rebuild children). `main.c`'s
  canonicalizer recurses into row elements. As with Layer 2, the `-Werror=switch`
  build is the guard that no future `FormTag` switch forgets rows.
- **Tests.** `tests/fixtures/errors/row-literal-value-position` (value-position
  rejection, end-to-end through reader -> form -> elaborator). A *positive*
  end-to-end fixture is deferred to Layer 4: a row is type-only, so until a
  row-kinded constructor exists to apply it to, there is no *sound* runtime
  program that uses one (see the finding below). The parse half is verified by
  `tur fmt` round-tripping `#row{...}`; the Type half by `tur_typerow_unit`.

**Finding filed during Layer 3:** using `#row{...}` as a *value*-type annotation
(e.g. a parameter type) is currently accepted instead of being a kind error, and
drops the row's elements (`TY_FN` stores only `TypeKind arg_kinds[]`). Not a live
miscompile (such a parameter is uncallable), but a soundness/diagnostic hole to
close in Layer 4. See
[docs/reported/row-type-in-value-position-loses-elements.md](row-type-in-value-position-loses-elements.md).

### Layer 4 -- row-kinded type parameter + kind soundness [LANDED]

A constructor can now declare a parameter of kind `[*]` (a row), a row is
kind-checked at every application, and a bare row is rejected in value
position. The runtime/codegen path for a row *type argument* already worked
(a row is a phantom type argument, erased at monomorphization), so this layer
is the kind-soundness layer on top of it, with a positive end-to-end fixture.

- **Marker `^&name`.** A `^&`-prefixed `defstruct` type parameter is row-kinded
  (`KIND_TYPEROW`); the `^&` is stripped so field types / call-site ascriptions
  use the bare name (`elab_structs.c`). The report's original `^[f]` idea does
  not tokenize (brackets are not symbol chars); `^&` is a single symbol token,
  distinct from `^`/`^^`, and the kind inference pass preserves it (it only
  upgrades `KIND_STAR` params). The struct's own `hkt_kind` stays arity-based
  (`kind_for_arity(n_params)`), so `(Query #row{...})` correctly yields kind `*`.
- **Argument-kind validation.** `check_row_type_arg_kind` (`elab_types.c`,
  shared by `type_expr_from_form` and `fn_type_from_form`'s application paths)
  rejects a row argument in a non-row slot and a non-row argument in a `^&` slot.
  Scoped to `KIND_TYPEROW` mismatches (xor), so it never perturbs existing
  non-row applications.
- **Value-position guard (closes the Layer 3 finding).** `fn_type_from_form` is
  split into a guarded public wrapper + an unguarded `_impl`. The wrapper
  rejects any value-type annotation that resolves to kind `[*]` (a bare row);
  internal sub-resolutions (application arguments, arrow components) use `_impl`
  so a row *argument* is still allowed. This fixes
  `docs/reported/row-type-in-value-position-loses-elements.md` (now RESOLVED):
  a bare row never reaches the lossy `TY_FN` parameter storage.
- **Tests.** Positive runtime fixture `hkt-row-query-phantom` (a `Query` over
  `#row{int bool}`, runs and prints `42`). Negatives:
  `errors/row-in-value-type-position` (the finding), `errors/row-arg-kind-row-param`
  (non-row -> `^&` slot), `errors/row-arg-kind-star-param` (row -> `*` slot), plus
  the Layer 3 `errors/row-literal-value-position` (row in value-expr position).

Not yet wired: `^&` on `defgadt`/ADTs and `deftype` (the latter's result-kind
heuristic mishandles the sentinel); a row that is *used in a field* (not just a
phantom) is unvalidated. Both are follow-ups, noted here, not on the critical
path for the ECS query use (phantom row argument).

### Layer 5 -- row algebra (membership, union/++, intersection) [LANDED]

The type-level operations the ECS query / relational layers build on, as both
C primitives and a type-level surface.

- **C primitives** (`types.c`, declared in `types.h`): `type_typerow_contains`
  (membership), `type_typerow_concat` (`++`, order-preserving, dup-keeping),
  `type_typerow_union` (deduplicated query join, order-preserving),
  `type_typerow_intersect` (common components, x's order, deduplicated). Pure
  compile-time `Type` operations.
- **Type-level surface** (`elab_types.c`, routed from `fn_type_from_form` too):
  `(row-concat A B ...)`, `(row-union A B ...)`, `(row-intersect A B ...)`
  fold over N row operands and elaborate, in type position, to a `TY_TYPEROW`
  usable wherever a row is -- e.g. a `^&` row-kinded type argument:
  `(Query (row-union #row{...} #row{...}))`. A non-row operand is a clear error.
- **Tests.** `tur_typerow_unit` gains exhaustive exact-content coverage of all
  four primitives (membership hits/misses, concat dup-keeping, union dedup +
  order, intersection + disjoint-empty). Fixtures: `hkt-row-ops-union` (a
  `Query` over `(row-union ...)`, runs end-to-end) and
  `errors/row-op-non-row-operand`.

Note on the fixture split: a row is a *phantom* type argument, and phantom type
arguments are not distinguished at value boundaries (pre-existing -- the same is
true of an ordinary phantom param, e.g. `(Schema int)` vs `(Schema bool)`).
So the fixtures validate that the surface parses, dispatches, yields a kind-`[*]`
row that satisfies the `^&` parameter, and runs; the *exact* row contents
(dedup, order, concat vs union) are validated by `tur_typerow_unit`. Reifying
row arguments so distinct rows are distinguished at value boundaries needs
witnesses and is a Layer 6+ concern.

### Layer 6 -- codegen erasure + ECS capstone [LANDED]

- **Runtime representation: full erasure.** A row is a *phantom* type argument
  -- it constrains types at compile time and carries no runtime data. At
  monomorphization the row never appears in a struct field or signature, so the
  emitted C is row-free; component data flows through the ordinary (int / world)
  handle. This is the "compile-time only" representation, not a reified
  element-tuple/iterator. The defensive `type_c_name` erase case
  (`/*type-row*/ void`, added in Layer 2) is a backstop that, in practice, never
  fires: `tur emit-c` on a row program contains **zero** `type-row` markers.
- **Erasure is pinned by compiled fixtures.** The fixture harness defaults to
  the *compiled* path (`needs_compiled=1`: `emit-c` -> `cc` -> run), so every
  `hkt-row-*` run-fixture exercises real codegen and would fail if a row ever
  leaked into C. No separate `expected.c` snapshot is needed.
- **ECS capstone fixtures** (the query the feature was built for):
  `hkt-row-ecs-query` -- opaque `Position`/`Velocity`/`Health` components, a
  `Query` parameterised by its component row, the combined row computed by
  `row-union` (a movement+damage join), run end-to-end. `hkt-row-ecs-query-in-out`
  -- the report's arrow-style `Query [Pos Vel] [Pos]` with separate input and
  output component rows. Both compile and run.

**Known gaps from the aspirational validation section** (documented, not on the
core path; each needs its own extension):

- ~~*Unregistered element types in a row do not error*~~ **CLOSED (L6
  follow-up A).** `#row{int Foo}` with `Foo` undefined is now a hard error
  ("unknown type name 'Foo' in #row{...} element position"); re-verified
  2026-08-17.
- ~~*Row-polymorphic `defn` ... is not wired: `^&` is recognised on
  `defstruct` params but not yet on `defn`/`fn` type params*~~ **CLOSED (L6
  follow-up B).** `^&name` is accepted in the `defn` type-param vector
  (`src/compiler/elab_fns.c`, the type-param-vector branch) and pinned by
  `tests/fixtures/hkt-row-polymorphic-defn` /
  `hkt-row-polymorphic-call-from-polymorphic`; re-verified 2026-08-17.  A
  surveying agent quoted this passage as current and reported the gap as
  live -- see docs/upcoming/row-types-followups-plan.md, whose hygiene rule
  ("strike closed gaps in archived docs") this edit finally applies to its
  own motivating example.  The `Row r` VALUE-wrapper half of the old bullet
  remains unbuilt by design (that is R2 of the same plan, deliberately not
  scheduled).
- *Permutation no-op as a type-checker behavior* (the data-frame
  `Frame [Name :str Age :int]` ~ `Frame [Age :int Name :str]`): `type_eq` on
  rows is order-*sensitive*; the order-insensitive `type_typerow_eq_perm` exists
  and is unit-tested but is not consulted during type-checking.  (Still true
  2026-08-17; `row-canon` is the explicit spelling for order-insensitive
  equality.)

## Status: all six layers landed

The variadic-HKT-rows feature is implemented end-to-end and the kind system is
sound: a constructor can be parameterised by a `#row{...}` row of types, rows
are kind-checked at every application, the row algebra (membership, `++`, union,
intersection) is available as primitives and a type-level surface, and rows are
fully erased at codegen. `ecs-spice-plan.md` E1's hard prerequisite (D1) is
satisfied for the phantom-row query use; the variadic `query` macro can now be
built on `#row{...}` + `row-union` instead of the arity-N `queryN` family.

Layer-by-layer: L1 kind-level `List Type` (`KIND_TYPEROW`); L2 `TY_TYPEROW`
variant + structural/permutation equality; L3 `#row{...}` reader syntax; L4
`^&` row-kinded parameters + kind soundness (closing the value-position
finding); L5 row algebra; L6 codegen erasure + ECS capstone. The follow-ups
above (strict row elements, row-polymorphic `defn`, permutation-aware
type-checking, `^&` on `defgadt`/`deftype`) are optional extensions, not
blockers.

**Revised critical path:** PRE-3 + Layer 2 are the high-value, low-risk next
step (pure type-layer C work, unit-testable in isolation, no syntax decision
needed). PRE-1 only gates Layer 3 onward, so the syntax decision can be made in
parallel without blocking Layer 2.

When all layers land, `ecs-spice-plan.md` E1 (the variadic `query` form) is
unblocked and the `queryN` macro family becomes a deprecation alias per that
plan's D1.
