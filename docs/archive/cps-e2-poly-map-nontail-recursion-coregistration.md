# E2: effect-poly-map -- non-tail effect-poly HOF whose fn-value param threads through the recursion

**STATUS: RESOLVED.** `effect-poly-map` DK-lowers with correct output
(`tick`/`tick`/`tick`), zero `eff=1`.  The fix turned out FAR smaller than the
greatest-fixpoint co-registration feared below: a self-recursive call passing a
param back at its OWN position is simply not an escape, so recognizing that in the
two structural predicates seeds the whole chain -- no fixpoint needed.

## The fix (a self-recursion arg is not an escape)

Two flag-gated, precisely-scoped changes (emit_cps_ir.c):
1. **`ptc_walk` / `param_thread_class`**: a `(fd ... p ...)` recursive call passing
   fd's own param `p` back at position `pi` no longer counts `p` as an escaping
   value-use (via `g_ptc_self_bind`/`g_ptc_self_pi` set by `param_thread_class`).
   So `param_thread_class(map-list, f)` returns PT_NONTAIL, not PT_NONE.  This is
   the SEED: it is structural (independent of the threadable set), so the
   value->param registration pass (A) can now count `__fn_1283`'s "pass to
   map-list f" use as OK and register it.
2. **`param_is_thread_safe`**: the recursion self-arg (`f` passed back at its own
   position) is trivially thread-safe -- it introduces no new fn-value.  So pass B
   registers `f` as a thread-param once `__fn_1283` is registered.

The exemption is exact -- only `p` at `p`'s OWN position in a self-recursive call;
`p` flowing to a DIFFERENT param position (or any other value-use) still counts as
an escape.  No greatest-fixpoint or optimistic seeding was required.

Flag-off byte-identical (all fixture snapshots unchanged); flag-on effect
soundness sweep clean; full suite green (2203/0).

## Original diagnosis (retained)

`effect-poly-map` stayed SIG-TAINT under `--enable=cps-tramp-resume` -- the
effect-poly HOF `map-list` DK-lowered (`map_hylist__cps` emitted) but its
fn-value param `f` never threaded, so the callback `__fn_1283` and `main` rode the
fiber.

## The shape

```turmeric
(defn map-list [n : int f :(fn [int] #fx{e} int)] #fx{e} : int
  (if (> n 0)
    (+ (f n) (map-list (- n 1) f))       ; NON-TAIL (f n) AND non-tail recursion passing f
    0))
(defn main [] : int
  (handle (do (map-list 3 (fn [x] (do (perform (Log "tick")) x))) 0)
    (Log [msg] k) (do (println msg) (resume k nil))))
```

## Root cause (a 2-node mutual-recursion cycle the least-fixpoint registration can't seed)

In the emitted `map_hylist__cps`, both fn-value edges fall back to the fiber:
- `(f n)` emits `((int64_t (*)(int64_t))f)(n)` -- f's DIRECT entry (fresh root
  prompt), NOT a registry thread; so the callback's `Log` perform escapes.
- the recursion emits `map_hylist((n)-1, f)` -- the DIRECT map-list, not
  `map_hylist__cps(..., __kont)`.

`(f n)` threads only if `f` is a thread-param, i.e. `param_is_thread_safe(map-list,
f)` (emit_cps_ir.c) -- which requires EVERY fn-value flowing into `f` to be
`threadable_has`.  Those are:
1. `__fn_1283` (from `main`'s `(map-list 3 <lambda>)`), and
2. `f` itself (from the recursion `(map-list (- n 1) f)` -- a fn-value ARG at the
   SAME param position).

Edge 2 fails today: `param_is_thread_safe` requires the arg be a registered
lifted lambda (`a->kind == EX_VAR && threadable_has(a->as.var.binding)`); a bare
param `f` is neither.  And edge 1 is circular: `__fn_1283` is registered only if
`fn_value_threadable(__fn_1283)` counts its "pass to `map-list` at param f" use as
OK, which requires `f` to ALREADY be a thread-param.  So:

    f thread-safe  <=>  __fn_1283 threadable

Both are TRUE in the sound answer, but the least-fixpoint (single pass, start
empty) registers neither: round 1 sees f not-a-thread-param -> __fn_1283 not ok
-> unregistered -> f not thread-safe.  No seed breaks the cycle.

## Fix direction (greatest-fixpoint co-registration + self-param recursion arg)

1. **`param_is_thread_safe`**: treat a recursion self-arg -- the callee's OWN
   param `pi` passed back at position `pi` in a call to the same `fd` -- as
   trivially safe (it threads the same row-poly value, introduces no new
   fn-value).
2. **Registration as a GREATEST fixpoint**: start with ALL candidate lambdas +
   HOF params assumed threadable, then iteratively REMOVE any lambda with a
   non-thread use or any param with a definitely-unregistered arg, until stable.
   The `__fn_1283`/`f` pair (whose only risky interaction is with each other)
   then survives as co-threadable.  (Today's least-fixpoint in the emit_cps_ir.c
   registration loops is the wrong direction for a mutually-recursive HOF.)
3. Then `(f n)` threads via the registry (E2a nontail heap join) and the
   recursion emits `map_hylist__cps((n)-1, f, <join>)`.

Both flag-gated; flag-off byte-identical; FULL flag-on soundness sweep mandatory
(this is the E2 family where a blanket relaxation was reverted before).

## Context

The non-tail residual left after the E2 row-poly TAIL cluster
(docs/archive/cps-e2-rowpoly-fnvalue-threading-boundary.md) and the E2c
struct-field cluster (docs/archive/cps-e2c-struct-field-effectful-fnvalue-threading.md).
Related: `effect-ref` (owning `ref<T>` live across a perform -- needs
owning-capture + drop glue in the continuation frame;
`owning_dropped_before_control` at emit_cps_ir.c:1816 rejects it), `fh-discharge-row`
(a `with-handler` that discharges one effect and leaves a leftover -- `do-work`
is not colored so it fiber-emits and taints the leftover), `effect-nested`
(value-position nested handle -- see cps-toplevel-synthesized-main-bypasses-dk.md),
`effect-capture-k` (by-reference mutable capture).
