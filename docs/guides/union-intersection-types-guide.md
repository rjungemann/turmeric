Union types (`A | B`) and intersection types (`A & B`) extend the Turmeric type system with
structural type combinations. Together they enable gradual typing, flexible APIs, and
type-safe duck typing without wrapper ADTs.

Both features, along with the `any` type, are enabled by default; no flag is required.

## Union Types

A union type `(A | B)` represents a value that is **either** `A` or **`B`**. At runtime
a union-typed value is carried as a `tur_tagged_t` (`{ int64_t tag; int64_t val; }`) --
a tag word plus one 64-bit payload slot.

### Syntax

```turmeric
;; Named union type
(deftype IntOrString []
  (int | cstr))

;; Inline in a function signature
(defn print-value [x : (int | cstr | bool)] : unit
  (match x
    (i : int)  (println i)
    (s : cstr) (println s)
    (b : bool) (println (if b "true" "false"))))
```

```sweet-exp
;; Named union type
deftype IntOrString []
  (int | cstr)

;; Inline in a function signature
defn print-value [x : (int | cstr | bool)] : unit
  match x
    (i : int)
    println(i)
    (s : cstr)
    println(s)
    (b : bool)
    println((if b "true" "false"))
```

Nested unions are flattened: `(int | (cstr | bool))` becomes `(int | cstr | bool)`.

### Pattern Matching on Union Types

Use `match` to narrow a union-typed value. The elaborator checks exhaustiveness across
all union members:

```turmeric
(defn describe [x : (int | cstr)] : cstr
  (match x
    (n : int)  (str "number: " n)
    (s : cstr) (str "string: " s)))
```

```sweet-exp
defn describe [x : (int | cstr)] : cstr
  match x
    (n : int)
    str("number: " n)
    (s : cstr)
    str("string: " s)
```

Omitting any member is a compile-time error (`TUR-E0301`).

### Subtyping

A value of type `A` can be passed anywhere `(A | B)` is expected (widening). This is
handled implicitly at call sites and return positions:

```turmeric
(defn accepts-union [x : (int | cstr)] : unit ...)

(accepts-union 42)       ;; int widens to (int | cstr)
(accepts-union "hello")  ;; cstr widens to (int | cstr)
```

```sweet-exp
defn accepts-union [x : (int | cstr)] : unit ...

accepts-union(42)       ;; int widens to (int | cstr)
accepts-union("hello")  ;; cstr widens to (int | cstr)
```

### Typeclass Methods on Unions

When `x : (int | cstr)`, typeclass methods implemented by **all** union members may be
called directly without a `match`. Methods not in the intersection require an explicit
`match` to narrow first:

```turmeric
;; Show is implemented by both int and cstr
(show x)   ;; ok -- in the instance intersection

;; Arithmetic is only on int; requires narrowing
(match x
  (n : int)  (+ n 1)
  (s : cstr) ...)
```

```sweet-exp
;; Show is implemented by both int and cstr
show(x)   ;; ok -- in the instance intersection

;; Arithmetic is only on int; requires narrowing
match x
  (n : int)
  {n + 1}
  (s : cstr)
  ...
```

---

## Intersection Types

An intersection type `(A & B)` represents a value that satisfies **both** `A` and `B`.
The primary use is combining a concrete type with typeclass constraints.

### Syntax

```turmeric
;; Named intersection type
(deftype ReadWrite []
  (Readable & Writable))

;; Inline in a function signature
(defn save [x : (int & Serializable)] : unit
  (file/write (serialize x) "output.bin"))
```

```sweet-exp
;; Named intersection type
deftype ReadWrite []
  (Readable & Writable)

;; Inline in a function signature
defn save [x : (int & Serializable)] : unit
  file/write(serialize(x) "output.bin")
```

### Subtyping

From a value of intersection type you can project either member:

- `(A & B) <: A` and `(A & B) <: B`
- A function expecting `A` accepts a value of type `(A & B)`

### Typeclass Intersection

Intersection is most useful when one side is a typeclass:

```turmeric
(defclass Serializable [a]
  (serialize [x : a] : cstr))

(defn serialize-int [x : (int & Serializable)] : cstr
  (serialize x))
```

```sweet-exp
defclass Serializable [a]
  serialize [x : a] : cstr

defn serialize-int [x : (int & Serializable)] : cstr
  serialize(x)
```

The value is an `int` with a `Serializable` dictionary attached. The elaborator
resolves the instance at the intersection type site.

### Unsatisfiable Intersections

Intersections of known-disjoint concrete types are rejected statically (`TUR-E0350`):

```turmeric
;; Compile error: int and cstr are disjoint
(defn bad [x : (int & cstr)] : unit ...)
```

```sweet-exp
;; Compile error: int and cstr are disjoint
defn bad [x : (int & cstr)] : unit ...
```

Intersections involving typeclasses or type variables that cannot be determined disjoint
at compile time are permitted and fail during instance resolution.

---

## The `any` Type

`any` is the **top type**: every type is a subtype of `any`. Like unions and
intersections, it is enabled by default.

```turmeric
(defn debug-print [x : any] : unit
  (println x))

(debug-print 42)      ;; ok
(debug-print "hello") ;; ok
(debug-print true)    ;; ok
```

```sweet-exp
defn debug-print [x : any] : unit
  println(x)

debug-print(42)      ;; ok
debug-print("hello") ;; ok
debug-print(true)    ;; ok
```

`any`-typed values are represented at codegen as a `tur_tagged_t`
(`{ int64_t tag; int64_t val; }`): the `tag` is the payload's `TypeKind` and
the `val` carries the payload. Immediate values (int/bool/nil) ride the
carrier directly, floats are stored as their IEEE-754 bit pattern, pointer
payloads (`cstr`, `ptr`, ADT handles) store the pointer, and by-value structs
are heap-boxed (a `malloc`'d copy whose pointer rides the carrier). A value is
boxed automatically wherever it is widened to `any` -- at a call argument, a
function's `: any` return position, or an `if` branch facing an `any` sibling.

Union simplification: `(int | cstr | any)` simplifies to `any`.

---

## Gradual Typing

Union types and `any` enable a gradual typing path:

```turmeric
;; Start untyped
(defn debug-print [x : any] : unit
  (println x))

;; Narrow gradually as types become known
(defn typed-print [x : (int | cstr)] : unit
  (debug-print x))
```

```sweet-exp
;; Start untyped
defn debug-print [x : any] : unit
  println(x)

;; Narrow gradually as types become known
defn typed-print [x : (int | cstr)] : unit
  debug-print(x)
```

---

## Boxing, `cast`, and `type-of`

A value widened to `any` is boxed into a `tur_tagged_t` that records the
payload's runtime type. Two forms read that box back:

- **`(type-of x)`** returns the payload's type name as a `cstr`. A primitive
  reports its kind -- `"int"`, `"bool"`, `"float"`, `"cstr"`, `"ptr"` -- and a
  struct or ADT reports **its own name**: `"Point"`, `"Shape"`. (It used to
  answer `"struct"` for every struct and `"adt"` for every ADT.)
- **`(cast x : T)`** is a *checked* downcast. It verifies the box tag matches
  `T` and returns the unboxed value; on a mismatch it **panics** (aborts with a
  message like `cast: any holds cstr, not int`). `T` may be a primitive type
  name or a struct/ADT name.

```turmeric
(defn box-it [] : any "hello")

(defn main [] : int
  (let [a (box-it)]
    (println (type-of a))    ;; => cstr
    (println (cast a cstr))  ;; => hello
    ;; (cast a int)          ;; would panic: any holds cstr, not int
    0))
```

The check is by TYPE, not by kind, so two struct types are distinguishable:

```turmeric
(defstruct Point [x : int y : int])
(defstruct Other [a : int b : int])

(let [a (:: (make-struct Point 3 4) any)]
  (println (type-of a))     ;; => Point
  (println (is? a Point))   ;; => true
  (println (is? a Other))   ;; => false
  ;; (cast a Other)         ;; panics: cast: any holds Point, not Other
  (.x (cast a Point)))      ;; => 3
```

Under the hood the box tag is a per-monomorph id for a struct/ADT payload (a
primitive keeps its `TypeKind`), and the program carries a table naming the ids
it allocated. `(Box int)` and `(Box float)` get distinct ids; `type-of` reports
the head name (`"Box"`) for both.

By-value structs are heap-boxed on widening (a `malloc`'d copy) and unboxed by
dereference on `cast`; ADTs and `cstr` are pointer-carried and ride the carrier
directly; floats are stored by their bit pattern so no precision is lost.

## ADTs and Unions (interop via `any`, not a desugar)

An early plan proposed desugaring `defdata` into a union type internally so the
two share one code path. That internal unification is **not pursued**: the union
machinery is monomorphic, closed, and non-recursive, while every `defdata` in
the tree is parametric (`Either [L R]`), higher-kinded (`Fix [^f]`,
`Free [^f a]`), recursive, or a GADT (`Nat`). Lowering those onto today's union
representation would mean rebuilding parametric/HKT/recursive/GADT sum-type
support on top of unions -- a far larger change with no user-visible payoff.

The user-facing goal that desugar was meant to deliver -- ADT values
participating in union-style dispatch -- **already ships** through the `any` top
type. An ADT value widens to `any` (boxing codegen), reports its kind via
`type-of` (`"adt"`), and lands back in `match` through a checked `cast`. See the
`defdata-as-union` and `any-box-adt` fixtures.

| `TUR-E0300` | Union type mismatch: expected `{expected}`, got `{actual}` |
| `TUR-E0301` | Non-exhaustive pattern match on union type `{type}` -- missing arm for `{variant}` |
| `TUR-E0350` | Intersection type unsatisfiable: no value can be both `{A}` and `{B}` |
| `TUR-E0351` | Value of type `{actual}` does not satisfy intersection member `{missing}` |

## Known Limitations

### Tagged Union Overhead

TypeScript's union types are zero-cost (erased). Turmeric carries every
union-typed value as a `tur_tagged_t` (`{ int64_t tag; int64_t val; }`): one
extra 64-bit tag word per value, with the payload riding a single 64-bit slot
(by-value structs are heap-boxed into it). This matters for arrays, struct
fields, and cache pressure.

Widening (passing `42` where `(int | cstr)` is expected) requires constructing
the tagged union at the call site -- it is not a free annotation.

> **Where the by-value heap box does and does not happen.** In ARGUMENT
> position, widening a by-value member for a call that provably neither retains
> the payload nor suspends puts the copy in the caller's frame instead, so there
> is no allocation at all -- the same rule, and the same inference, that makes an

> returned, or held as a temporary) still boxes, and that box has no owner: one

> the remaining positions need.

Two member kinds do not ride the `val` slot as an integer, and both the inject
and the `match` binder account for it: a by-value aggregate is heap-boxed and
the slot holds a pointer, and a `float` rides as its IEEE-754 bit pattern rather
than a numeric conversion.

### `if`-Guard Narrowing (`any`)

Flow-sensitive narrowing works in `if` guards on an `any`-typed variable. A
type-test guard in the condition refines the variable to the tested type inside
the **then**-branch, so it can be used at that type with no explicit cast. Two
guard shapes are recognized:

```turmeric
;; (is? x T) -- the dedicated type-test predicate
(defn bump [x : any] : int
  (if (is? x int)
    (+ x 1)     ;; x is narrowed to int here -- no cast needed
    0))

;; (= (type-of x) "T") -- type-of compared against a string literal
(if (= (type-of x) "int")
  (+ x 1)
  0)
```

Chaining handles multi-type dispatch:

```turmeric
(defn describe [v : any] : cstr
  (if (is? v int)   "int"
    (if (is? v bool) "bool"
      (if (is? v Point) "point" "other"))))
```

`(is? x T)` is also a plain boolean predicate (it requires an `any`-typed
argument, like `type-of` and `cast`). The runtime check compares the value's
box tag to `T`; `T` may be a primitive, struct, or ADT name.

**Supported guard shapes (narrow):** a direct `(is? x T)` or
`(= (type-of x) "T")` test on a single `any` variable, used as the whole `if`
condition. **Unsupported (do not narrow):** negation (`(not (is? x T))`),
conjunction/disjunction of tests, the else-branch complement, and tests on
union (`A | B`) variables. For unions, use `match`, which narrows exhaustively:

```turmeric
(match x
  (n : int)  (+ n 1)
  (s : cstr) ...)
```

### Intersection is Constraint-Only

TypeScript and Scala 3 merge struct fields across intersections
(`{ x: int } & { y: bool }` gives `{ x: int; y: bool }`). Turmeric statically
rejects intersections of two known-disjoint concrete types. Intersection is only
useful when at least one side is a typeclass.

### Closed Unions

Union types are closed -- the member set is fixed at definition time. A library
returning `(int | ParseError)` cannot be transparently composed with one returning
`(bool | ParseError)` without an explicit adapter.

### Variance with Generics

Variance for type constructors containing union or intersection types is not yet
specified. Passing `(vec (int | cstr))` where `(vec int)` is expected may produce
unexpected behaviour.

## Deferred

The following items are not yet implemented:

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Tagged union C codegen | General `struct { int tag; union { A a; B b; } data; }` emission for `(A \| B)` unions (the `any` top type ships via `tur_tagged_t`) |
| ADT-as-union sugar | Not pursued -- infeasible against monomorphic unions (defdata is parametric/HKT/recursive/GADT). ADTs already interoperate with unions via `any` boxing; see [ADTs and Unions](#adts-and-unions-interop-via-any-not-a-desugar). |
