/* platform_proc.h - portable pieces of a shell-string subprocess.
 *
 * Every `system()` / `popen()` call site in the package and install paths
 * builds a SHELL COMMAND STRING.  That string is handed to /bin/sh on POSIX and
 * to cmd.exe on Windows, and the two agree on almost none of its syntax.  Two
 * differences account for every failure observed so far:
 *
 *   1. The null device.  `2>/dev/null` is a redirect to a path cmd.exe cannot
 *      resolve; it prints "The system cannot find the path specified." and the
 *      command fails.  cmd.exe spells it `NUL`.
 *
 *   2. Quoting.  cmd.exe does not treat `'` as a quote character AT ALL, so a
 *      single-quoted argument is passed through with the quotes still attached
 *      and the callee sees a literal `'C:\path'`.  Windows wants double quotes.
 *
 * Both failures are SILENT in the way that matters: the command runs, does
 * nothing, and returns a status the caller may or may not check.  `tur new`
 * scaffolded a project and skipped `git init` while exiting 0, and reported
 * "git config user.name not set" on a machine where it was plainly set --
 * because the probe that read it had failed, not because the value was absent.
 *
 * On every non-Windows platform this compiles to the POSIX spellings, so it is
 * safe (and cheap) to include unconditionally.
 *
 * See docs/reported/windows-subprocess-and-shared-lib-gaps.md.

 * quote, which is safe against every metacharacter sh has.
 *
 * Windows: double quotes.  Inside them cmd.exe leaves &, |, <, >, ^ alone, and
 * the CRT's argument parser handles the rest.  An embedded double quote is
 * escaped as \", and a run of backslashes immediately BEFORE such a quote has
 * to be doubled -- that is the CRT's documented rule, and getting it wrong is
 * how a trailing separator in a directory path (`C:\dir\`) silently escapes the
 * closing quote and swallows the next argument.
