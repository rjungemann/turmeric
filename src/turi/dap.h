 * Debugger Phase 3: Debug Adapter Protocol server over the interpreter.
 *
 * `tur dap` speaks the Debug Adapter Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 with Content-Length
 * framing, the same transport as `tur lsp`) on stdin/stdout, driving the Phase 2
 * TuriDebugger through its Phase 3 control API (eval.h).  Any DAP client -- VS
 * Code, nvim-dap, etc. -- can launch a .tur program under the interpreter and
 * get breakpoints / stepping / call-stack / locals.
 *
 * The server is transport-only: it does not know how to construct an interpreter
 * environment.  The embedder supplies a launch callback that builds the env,
 * calls dap_begin_session() once the debugger is enabled, runs the program, and
 * returns its exit code.  See src/main.c (dap_launch_cb).
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

 *   1. construct the interpreter env for `program` (with `args`/`n_args`),
 *   2. enable the debugger and call dap_begin_session(state, env) BEFORE arming,
 *   3. arm and run main to completion,
 *   4. call dap_end_session(state, env) before freeing the env,
 *   5. return the program's exit code.
