/* jit_ffi.h -- JIT-scoped dynamic FFI via c2mir (jit-ffi-c2mir-plan).
 *
 * The interpreter is the one consumer that genuinely needs call signatures
 * materialized at runtime; the JIT is exactly where it already lives.  This
 * header is the insulation layer between the two: tur_core TUs (ffi_thunk.c,
 * eval.c) consult a PROVIDER installed at startup by a JIT build, and stay
 * MIR-free themselves -- eighteen targets consume tur_core's objects
 * (including the WASM build) and none of them may grow a MIR link line.
 *
 * The provider synthesizes tiny C thunks with c2mir for signatures described
 * by a shape string (section 2.1 of the plan):
 *
 *     sig := <ret-class> ':' <arg-class>*
 *
 *     'i'  int64 register class (:int, :bool, :cstr, :ptr<T>, sized ints)
 *     'f'  double
 *     'F'  float32 (exact ABI class -- NOT widened at the call boundary)
 *     'v'  void (return position only)
 *     '{'  ... '}'  struct by value (F4, see below)
 *
 * e.g. "i:ifi" = int64 f(int64, double, int64); "v:" = void f(void);
 * "{ff}:{ff}{ff}" = struct{double,double} f(struct{...}, struct{...}).
 *
 * F4 struct-by-value.  A '{' opens an aggregate whose members are spelled
 * with EXACT-WIDTH codes -- unlike the scalar vocabulary above, an
 * aggregate's layout and its ABI classification both depend on the precise
 * size and alignment of every member, so 'i' (a register class) is not
 * enough information to render one:
 *
 *     'b'  1-byte integer  (:bool, :int8, :uint8)
 *     'h'  2-byte integer  (:int16, :uint16)
 *     'w'  4-byte integer  (:int32, :uint32)
 *     'q'  8-byte integer  (:int, :int64, :uint64)
 *     'p'  pointer         (:cstr, :ptr<T>)
 *     'F'  float  (4 bytes)
 *     'f'  double (8 bytes)
 *     '{' ... '}'  nested aggregate
 *
 * Signedness is deliberately absent: it affects neither layout nor
 * classification, and the Turmeric-side field types (the record ADT's
 * CtorFields) are what decide how a member is read back into a value.  The
 * sig carries layout only.
 *
 * In a non-JIT build no provider is ever installed and every consumer keeps
 * today's behavior (per-export __ffi shims, the generated shape table, the
 * extern-c nil stub, a clean "requires a JIT-enabled build" diagnostic for
 * call-ptr).  The provider interface is deliberately the swap point if
 * Windows/WASM ever need a non-MIR thunk source (dyncall / libffi). */
