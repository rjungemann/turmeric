/* preload.h -- shared stdlib preload sequence for interpreter entry points.
 *
 * The tree-walking interpreter starts from a bare `TuriEnv` that only knows the
 * elaborator builtins (`+`, `let`, `if`, `fn`, ...).  Every real program needs
 * the core macros (`when`/`cond`/`for`/`and`/`or`) and the typed-collection
 * stdlib (Map/Set/Vec/Option/Result/...) loaded on top of that env before user
 * code runs.  `src/main.c`'s `--interpret` entry point (`cmd_eval`) has always
 * done this inline; the WASM/browser REPL (`src/web/wasm_glue.c`) skipped it,
 * so reader-macro data literals such as `#map{...}` (which lower to the
 * `hamt-of` macro defined in `stdlib/map.tur`) failed with "unknown function or
 * operator 'hamt-of'".  See docs/archive/history/web-repl-missing-stdlib-preload.md.
 *
 * These two helpers factor that load sequence out of `main.c` so the native
 * interpreter and the WASM REPL share one copy and cannot drift.  They only
 * emit `(load "<root>/<file>")` forms; the underlying Vec/Set/Map/HAMT runtime
 * ops are already registered as natives by `turi_env_new`
 * (`turi_register_collection_natives`), so no extra native wiring is required
 * for the collection literals to evaluate.
