 * Symbol harvesting (LD1)
 *
 * Walks an elaborated program and records every global binding -- name,
 * rendered type, defining span, defining file -- into a caller-supplied
 * LspSymbol array. This is the whole of what the LSP means by "analysis": the
 * compiler does the work, this reads the result off the tree.
 *
 * Split out of main.c so the walk has exactly one implementation. `tur lsp`
 * reaches it through compile_to_c; the WASM playground reaches it through its
 * own front end (src/web/wasm_lsp.c), which has no CLI to inherit. Leaving the
 * walk welded to main.c would have forced the second caller to grow a copy,
 * and a copy is how the two would quietly stop agreeing about what a symbol is.
 *
 * Single-threaded: one collection is in flight at a time, bracketed by
 * begin/end.
