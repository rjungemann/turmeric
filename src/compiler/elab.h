/* Elaborate a sequence of top-level Forms into a typed Expr program. The
 * result is an Expr of kind EX_PROGRAM, or NULL if any error was diagnosed.
 *
 * `arena` and `st` must outlive the returned Expr (it points into them).
 * `module_base_dir` is the directory to search for imported module files
 * (Phase M2); pass NULL or "." to use the current working directory.
 * `separate_compilation` (Phase M3): when true, imported modules are not
 * inlined; callers emit separate .h/.c per module and #include them.
 * `out_tc_env` (CPS-CL10): if non-NULL, the typeclass environment collected
 * during elaboration is written here on success; the caller may pass this
 * to cps_transform for Clone-instance checking of captured bindings.
 * `out_n_file_scope_defs` (Tier 3): if non-NULL, the number of file-scope
 * definition items prepended to the program (from imported modules) is
 * written here on success; used by the interpreter to distinguish these
 * from (load ...) -expanded forms when computing evaluation ranges. */

 * by module loaders (elab_module.c, elab_toplevel.c) so imported files

/* TR2 (turi-incremental-elaboration-design): persistent elaboration session.
 *
 * A long-lived interpreter env (REPL / notebook kernel / embedded turi) re-runs
 * `elaborate_program` over the WHOLE accumulated program on every eval, because
 * the elaborator builds its scope, typeclass env, and ADT/effect/module
 * registries from scratch each call -- so resolving a new form's references to
 * earlier definitions requires re-elaborating those definitions too. That is
 * O(N^2) in retained elaboration memory over a session.
 *
 * An ElabSession keeps that state alive between calls. The caller hands
 * `elaborate_program_session` only the NEW forms; references to earlier
 * definitions resolve out of the session's accumulated scope. Nothing inside
 * the elaborator changes -- the caller slices the form array.
 *
 * Lifetime: Expr/Type nodes produced by a call live in the Arena passed to that
 * call, so every arena whose output the session still references must stay
 * alive (the interpreter retains all eval arenas, which is why this is sound
 * there). The session itself owns malloc'd bookkeeping freed by
 * elab_session_free.
 *
 * On ANY failed call the session must be discarded (partial definitions from
 * the failed program may have entered its scope); the caller then starts a
 * fresh session and replays the accumulated forms. */
