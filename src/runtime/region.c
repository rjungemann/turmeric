/* region.c -- declared lifetimes (RM3).  See region.h for the design and
 * docs/archive/regions-plan.md for the phase.
 *
 * One Arena per generation rather than watermarks into a shared one.  Arena
 * exposes `arena_reset` (whole-arena rewind) and `arena_owns`, not a
 * save/restore watermark, so a per-generation Arena is what the existing API
 * supports without changing it -- and it makes `tur_region_owns` a walk over
 * generations instead of an address-range comparison that would have to know
 * about interleaving.
 *
 * A generation popped WITHOUT reclaim is retired, not freed: its memory stays
 * mapped for the process.  That is deliberately the status quo (the spine
 * leaks today), so the conservative path costs nothing new, and it keeps
 * `tur_region_owns` true for those pointers -- a value that outlived its
 * generation must still never reach `free()`.
 *
 * THREADS (region-lock-hardening, 2026-09-06).  The generation stack is
 * PER-THREAD (`__thread`, exactly as src/runtime/trail.c keeps the trail and
 * tur_tls.c keeps the panic state): a bracket is a stack discipline over one
 * thread's control flow, and `bt-scope` already pushes a per-thread trail
 * level, so its generation belongs to the same thread.  With one process-wide
 * stack, a worker thread's spine nodes landed in whatever generation the main
 * thread happened to have open -- through an unsynchronised push_ptr/realloc
 * -- and were rewound under the worker when that bracket closed.
 *
 * What does NOT follow the thread is OWNERSHIP.  A node allocated in thread
 * A's generation and dropped by thread B must still never reach free(), so
 * `tur_region_owns` consults a process-wide registry of every arena that is
 * live or retired in ANY thread.  The registry is touched under a spinlock at
 * push, retire and reclaim (once per bracket, never per allocation), and the
 * ownership query skips the lock entirely while every registered arena is
 * this thread's own -- which is every single-threaded program, and every
 * multi-threaded one in which only one thread has ever opened a region. */
