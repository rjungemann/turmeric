/* =========================================================================
 * CPS5 (cps-transform-plan): multi-prompt delimited-control machine.
 *
 * The Dybvig--Peyton-Jones--Sabry model, expressed over heap continuation
 * chains (a CPS program is a chain; this is the same shape CPS4's TurKont uses,
 * specialized here with prompt/shift markers so the machine can capture
 * sub-continuations by *slicing the chain*):
 *
 *   - reset = a prompt marker in the chain (DK_PROMPT, tag t).
 *   - shift(t, body) / shift0(t, body) capture the sub-continuation from the
 *     shift point up to the nearest enclosing prompt tagged t, reify it as a
 *     callable chain, and run body with it. shift RE-INSTALLS the prompt on the
 *     captured sub (so resuming re-delimits); shift0 does NOT (CPS0.2 table).
 *   - the captured sub is multi-shot: dk_invoke runs a fresh copy each time, so
 *     call/cc* / cloneable resume is just "invoke more than once".
 *   - an implicit ROOT prompt (DK_ROOT_TAG) lets an undelimited capture reach
 *     program entry (CPS5.3): dk_run_root treats program end as the prompt.
 *
 * Standalone machine (not yet wired into codegen). Exercised by
 * tests/cps_prompt_unit.c.

 * A frame whose captured env holds an OWNING value (an rc handle, or an
 * aggregate with owning fields) carries a clone/drop pair so a multi-shot
 * resume gets its own correctly-refcounted copy instead of a shared shallow
 * alias.  Both default NULL, in which case dk_copy_node keeps today's shallow
 * env-pointer copy and dk_free never touches the env -- byte-identical to the
 * pre-E3a behavior for every Copy-only / borrow-only frame.
 *
 *   env_clone -- run on each dk_copy_node that copies an owning frame (capture
 *     via dk_copy_range, and every dk_invoke replay via dk_copy): return an
 *     owned copy of `env` (rc: incref + return the same handle; aggregate:
 *     deep-copy + clone each owning field).  Its result becomes the copy's env.
 *   env_drop  -- run on each dk_free of an owning frame: drop each owning field
 *     (rc: decref; aggregate: drop fields + free the struct).  Runs BEFORE the
 *     node itself is freed.
 *
 * Accounting (the E3a obligation): base populate = +1; each copy = +1 clone and
 * -1 drop at its dk_free; net zero once every copy AND the base chain are freed.
 * In the standalone machine the base chain is freed by its owner, so accounting
 * balances to zero; the emitted E3a path leaks only the base +1 until E3b's
