 *      delimited capture (small `reset`s), retained per CPS0.4 / OQ-CPS2.
 *
 *   2. TurKont (src/runtime/cps_rt.h) + the DK prompt machine
 *      (src/runtime/cps_prompt.h) -- the *heap-reified* CPS substrate. A
 *      continuation is a heap closure chain; capture is an O(1) pointer take
 *      and is UNBOUNDED in depth (validated at 500k frames). The
 *      TUR_CONT_MAX_CAPTURED_FRAMES ceiling does NOT apply there. Undelimited
 *      capture to the implicit root prompt uses this path.
 *
