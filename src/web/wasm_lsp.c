/* wasm_lsp.c -- the LSP server, reachable from JavaScript.
 *
 * `tur lsp` already implements completion, hover, diagnostics, go-to-
 * definition, document symbols, and signature help, and after the
 * lsp-client-gaps work it does so at a quality a real editor shipped
 * against. None of that is re-implemented here. What a browser lacks is a
 * *transport*: lsp_server_run() is a blocking read(2)/write(2) loop and there
 * is no descriptor to block on.
 *
 * src/lsp/lsp_session.c supplies the loop-free entry point. This file supplies
 * the two things that are specific to running it inside the WASM bundle:
 *
 *   1. The JS bridge -- one JSON string in, one JSON string out.
 *   2. tur_collect_symbols, the analysis backend. The native one lives in
 *      main.c and runs the whole compile_to_c pipeline; main.c is a CLI and is
 *      not part of the WASM source set, so the browser gets its own front end
 *      over the same shared pieces (the stdlib autoload in
 *      compiler/stdlib_autoload.c, the binding walk in lsp/lsp_collect.c).
 *
 * The browser's front end stops after elaboration. Everything the LSP reports
 * -- names, types, spans, type errors -- exists by the end of that pass; the
 * passes after it (effect lowering, CPS, borrow check) exist to produce a
 * binary, which nobody in a browser is asking for. Skipping them makes an
 * analysis roughly a parse-and-typecheck, which is the difference between
 * completion feeling instant and completion feeling like a build.
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: a borrow-check or lifetime error will
 * not appear as a marker in the playground. Those are the diagnostics a user
 * hits after the code already type-checks, and the playground's Run button
 * still reports them.
